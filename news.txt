   SAN SALVADOR, 13 JAN 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN OPPOSITION
NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MNR) TODAY DEMANDED THAT GUATEMALAN
PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO "THOROUGHLY" INVESTIGATE THE ASSASSINATION OF MNR
LEADER HECTOR OQUELI AND OF GUATEMALAN ATTORNEY GILDA FLORES.

   DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE, THE MNR EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE CONDEMNED THE
"ABOMINABLE" CRIME PERPETRATED ON 12 JANUARY IN GUATEMALA BY ARMED MEN
WEARING CIVILIAN CLOTHES.  THE MNR ALSO DEMANDED THAT THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT GUARANTEE THE SECURITY OF MNR SECRETARY GENERAL GUILLERMO UNGO,
WHO WILL ARRIVE IN EL SALVADOR WITHIN THE NEXT FEW HOURS TO ATTEND OQUELI'S
FUNERAL, WHICH IS SCHEDULED FOR 15 JANUARY.

   OQUELI, 45, AND GILDA FLORES, A MEMBER OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST PARTY
(PSD) OF GUATEMALA, WERE KIDNAPPED WHILE THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY TO LA AURORA
AIRPORT IN GUATEMALA CITY.  THEIR BODIES WERE FOUND LATER AT A PLACE NEAR
THE SALVADORAN BORDER.

   "THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS UNJUSTIFIABLE ASSASSINATION ARE THE
ETERNAL ENEMIES OF LIBERTY, PEACE, AND DEMOCRACY," THE MNR STATES.  THE MNR,
ALONG WITH THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THE SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PEOPLE'S
MOVEMENT [MPSC], MAKE UP THE DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE COALITION.

   THE MPSC ALSO ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE DEPLORING THE ASSASSINATION OF OQUELI
AND URGING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO CONDEMN THIS ACTION.

   CLANDESTINE, 8 JAN 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [STATION COMMENTARY]
[TEXT] GOODBYE [AIR FORCE COMMANDER] GENERAL RAFAEL BUSTILLO, FALSE
HOPE FOR MASS KILLERS.  GEN.  BUSTILLO RESIGNS OR IS MADE TO RESIGN AS
THE AIR FORCE CHIEF.  BECAUSE OF THIS, THE GENERAL IS ADMITTING THAT
WITHOUT THE BOMBING ON SAN SALVADOR'S NEIGHBORHOODS THE FMLN
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] WOULD HAVE DEFEATED THE
SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES.  BUSTILLO'S RESIGNATION IS YET ANOTHER SIGN
OF THE FAILURE OF 10 YEARS OF THE U.S. COUNTERINSURGENCY POLICY IN EL
SALVADOR, AS BECAME CLEAR WITH THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED ON 10 NOVEMBER.

   FOR 10 YEARS THE MILITARY AND THEIR U.S. SPONSORS BASED THEIR TRUST IN THE
AIR POWER TO DROWN IN BLOOD THE ASPIRATION OF THE NATION TO ACHIEVE
DEMOCRACY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE.  THIS FIRST HAPPENED IN THE INTERIOR OF THE
COUNTRY, WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF DOZENS OF TOWNS LIKE TENANCINGO, BERLIN,
TOROLA, SAN FERNANDO, AND SO MANY OTHERS THAT TOOK PLACE ALONG WITH THE
GENOCIDE CARRIED OUT BY THE INFANTRY WITH THE MASS MURDERS OF CIVILIANS IN
EL MOSOTO, SUNPUL, AND OCOTAPAYO.  BUSTILLO IS LEAVING AS SO MANY GENERALS
AND U.S. AMBASSADORS HAVE.  AND LIKE ALL OF THEM HIS DEPARTURE REVEALS THE
IMPERIALIST POWER'S FAILURE TO CONSOLIDATE ITS COUNTERINSURGENCY PROGRAM IN
EL SALVADOR.

   AS ALL THE OTHERS WHO HAVE LEFT, BUSTILLO ALSO SEEKS EXCUSES IN THE FACE
OF HIS FAILURE, BY ACCUSING OTHERS.  HE ACCUSES [FORMER DEFENSE MINISTER
EUGENIO] VIDES CASANOVA OF BEING SOFT IN FIGHTING THE PEOPLE'S PLAN.  ONE
WOULD HAVE TO ASK BUSTILLO IF THE AIR FORCE, OF WHICH HE REPRESENTED ITS
MOST ENCOURAGING PILLAR, WAS SOFT WHEN IT MURDERED 70,000 SALVADORANS,
MONSIGNOR ARNULFO ROMERO AND THE JESUIT PRIESTS INCLUDED, AND EVEN WHEN IT
MURDERED PATRIOT OFFICERS OF THAT SAME ARMY.  WAS THE U.S. PENTAGON SOFT
WHEN IT GAVE $3 BILLION, WEAPONS, AND BOMBS FOR THE MOST COWARDLY ACT OF
GENOCIDE LATIN AMERICA CAN RECALL THIS CENTURY?

   THE U.S. STRATEGY, IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE TOP MILITARY COMMAND IN THE
PAST 10 YEARS WITH ALL ITS MIGHT DID ALL IT COULD SO THAT THE PERMANENT
REBELLION IN THE RURAL AREAS REACHED THE COUNTRY'S VITAL CENTERS, AS INDEED
HAPPENED AS OF THE 10 NOVEMBER OFFENSIVE.  BUSTILLO STATES IT CLEARLY.

   THE BOMBING TEMPORARILY HALTED THE DEFEAT OF THE TOP COMMAND.  THROUGH AN
ACT OF GENOCIDE, IT MANAGED TO REMOVE THE DISGRUNTLED PEOPLE FROM THE
NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THE GUERRILLA FORCES WERE.  BUSTILLO ACKNOWLEDGES
GENOCIDE IS THE SOLE WAY THE ARMED FORCES CAN SURVIVE.  BUSTILLO
ACKNOWLEDGES THE FMLN'S STRENGTH AND THEREFORE URGES THE ARMED FORCES TO BE
TOUGHER AND INFLEXIBLE AND REJECTS A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT.  A
POLITICAL SOLUTION WOULD EXPRESS THE CONSENSUS AMONG THE COUNTRY'S MAJOR
SECTORS.  OBVIOUSLY THE TOP COMMAND REPRESENTS A DECADENT MINORITY.
BUSTILLO SUPPORTS LAUNCHING A FASCIST CRUSADE AGAINST THE PEOPLE'S WISH FOR
DEMOCRACY.  IN THIS EFFORT, HE LASHES OUT AT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, ALL
OPPOSITION SECTORS THAT REPORT HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, AND ALL SECTORS THAT
SUPPORT DEMOCRATIZING THE COUNTRY.  IN CONCLUSION, WE SAY THAT BUSTILLO IS
NOT RESIGNING OF HIS OWN VOLITION.  THE FMLN ACTION ELIMINATED BUSTILLO AS
IT ELIMINATED GARCIA, VIDES, AND SO MANY OTHER MILITARY CHIEFS WHO LEFT
THEIR POSTS WITHOUT FULFILLING THE TASK COMMISSIONED BY THE UNITED STATES:
TO STOP THE FMLN.

   THE FMLN OFFENSIVE BARED THE GENOCIDAL, ANTIPOPULAR, AND FASCIST NATURE OF
THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI REGIME TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT IT PROMPTED A STRONG
DEBATE IN THE UNITED STATES ON CUTTING MILITARY AID.  THE JESUITS' MURDERS
AND THE BOMBINGS SO SHOOK THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT IT IS PRESSURING
FOR PUNISHMENT OF THE OFFICERS INVOLVED IN THESE INCIDENTS.  HOWEVER, THE
BUSH ADMINISTRATION ACCEPTED THIS, SINCE COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE [CHAIRMAN
OF THE JOINTS CHIEFS OF STAFF] AND HIS CLIQUE, EVEN CRISTIANI, MUST SHOULDER
THIS RESPONSIBILITY.  WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT IN COSTA RICA THE SALVADORAN
DEFENSE MINISTER DISCLOSED CRISTIANI AUTHORIZED THE BOMBINGS.

   BUSH NEEDED A SCAPEGOAT TO PLACE IT ON THE ALTAR OF THE DEBATES WHICH WILL
BEGIN IN THE U.S. CONGRESS ON THE FATE OF MILITARY AID.  BUSTILLO IS BUSH'S
SCAPEGOAT.  HOWEVER, BUSTILLO WAS ALREADY A USELESS ELEMENT OF THE MURDEROUS
MACHINERY THAT REMAINS ACTIVE.  WILL THE U.S. PUBLIC AND CONGRESS BE
APPEASED WITH THIS FOUL TASTING CANDY?  TIME AND THE SPIRIT OF THE TIMES ARE
OBVIOUSLY RUNNING AGAINST THE FASCIST PROGRAM IN EL SALVADOR.  WHILE PEOPLES
OF THE WORLD TEAR DOWN DOGMAS, DICTATORSHIPS, AND WALLS, BUSTILLO, WHO
LEAVES THROUGH THE DOOR OF DEFEAT, ASKS THE ARMED FORCES TO BE TOUGHER,
COMMIT MORE GENOCIDE, AND BUILD MORE WALLS OF REPRESSION AGAINST THE CHURCH,
THE PEOPLE, AND THE NATION AS A WHOLE.  GOODBYE, GEN. BUSTILLO.  WE CONTINUE
WRITING HISTORY WITHOUT YOU.  THE DECADE WE BEGIN IS OF DEMOCRACY,
INDEPENDENCE, AND SELF-DETERMINATION.  THAT IS WHY FOREIGN INTERVENTION AND
THE WALLS OF INTOLERANCE HAVE A SHORT LIFE SPAN IN THIS COUNTRY, WHERE THE
PEOPLE GROW IN HEROISM AND THE STRUGGLE FOR SOCIAL CHANGE IS NOT DETERRED BY
BOMBINGS.

   TEGUCIGALPA, 7 FEB (REUTER) -- [TEXT] A BOMB BLAST DAMAGED A TELEPHONE
OFFICE TODAY IN THE NORTHERN CITY OF SAN PEDRO SULA.  A LEFTIST GROUP,
WHICH CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR AN ATTACK ON A U.S. MILITARY CONVOY LAST
WEEK CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS ATTACK.

   THE BOMB, MADE UP OF DYNAMITE AND A FUSE, EXPLODED JUST BEFORE DAWN IN
THE HONDUTEL [HONDURAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS ENTERPRISE] OFFICE IN SAN PEDRO
SULA, 190 KM NORTH OF THIS CAPITAL.

   THE EXPLOSION DAMAGED FURNITURE, FOUR TELEPHONES, AND SHATTERED
WINDOWS, BUT NOBODY WAS INJURED.

   LEAFLETS FOUND IN THE RUBBLE STATED THAT A LEFTIST GROUP WAS RESPONSIBLE
BOTH FOR THE BOMB AS WELL AS THE ATTACK ON A U.S. MILITARY CONVOY LAST WEEK
IN THE HONDURAN NORTHERN MOUNTAIN REGION.

   ALTHOUGH NO CASUALTIES WERE REPORTED, ONE OF THE VEHICLES IN THE U.S.
CONVOY WAS HIT BY TWO BULLETS.  UNTIL TODAY NOBODY HAD CLAIMED CREDIT FOR
THAT ATTACK.

   "THE JACOBO CARCOMO COMMAND OF THE MORAZANIST PATRIOTIC FRONT [FPM]
ATTACKED A U.S. CONVOY WITH M-16 RIFLE-FIRE," THE LEAFLETS READ.  CARCOMO
WAS A HONDURAN LEFT-WING AUTHOR AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 20TH CENTURY.

   THE FPM, NAMED AFTER A CENTRAL AMERICAN LEADER OF THE LAST CENTURY, HAS
CLAIMED CREDIT FOR SEVERAL GUERRILLA ATTACKS IN THE PAST.

   HONDURAS HAS BEEN GRIPPED BY A WAVE OF VIOLENCE THIS YEAR, INCLUDING THE
ASSASSINATIONS OF A FORMER ARMED FORCES COMMANDER, A COMMANDER OF THE
ANTI-SANDINIST REBELS (SUPPORTED BY THE UNITED STATES), AND A LAWYER OF AN
ALLEGED DRUG TRAFFICKING TSAR.

   PRESIDENT JOSE AZCONA HAS CALLED FOR NATIONAL DIALOGUE STARTING THIS
WEEK WITH THE GOVERNMENT, THE OPPOSITION PARTIES, LABOR UNIONS,
BUSINESSMEN, AND OTHER GROUPS TO TRY TO CURB THE SUDDEN SURGE OF VIOLENCE.

   HONDURAS, A CLOSE U.S. ALLY, HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN A PEACEFUL COUNTRY

TWO TRUCKS FILLED WITH SOLDIERS.

   THE SANTA RITA POLICE CHIEF FOUND THE BODIES OF A SOLDIER AND A REBEL
ON THE ROAD LEADING TO SANTA RITA.  THE SOLDIER WAS IDENTIFIED AS EDISON

WHERE THE ARMY DISMANTLED DURING HOLY WEEK A FARC 37TH FRONT PLAN DESIGNED
TO COMMIT AND CARRY OUT AMBUSHES AND ASSAULTS.

   MEANWHILE, AT LEAST 50 FARC REBELS BLEW UP A JEEP NEAR SAN JUAN DE URAMA

OF THE OPERATIONS CONDUCTED BY 5TH BRIGADE TROOPS COMMANDED BY GENERAL
ALFONSO VACA PERILLA IN THE AREAS OF EL CARMEN AND SAN VICENTE DE CHUCURRI,

   COL JORGE ERNESTO FERRERO ECHEVERRI, SANTANDER DEPARTMENT POLICE
COMMANDER, SAID THE SPECIAL SECURITY COUNCIL WILL MEET TODAY (MONDAY) TO
ASSESS THE SITUATION.

   COL FERRERO EXPLAINED THAT "IN PRINCIPLE, WE HAVE REPORTS SAYING MANY
PEOPLE WERE KILLED, BUT WE DO NOT KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY.  WE KNOW SEVEN
PEASANTS WERE MURDERED BY FARC 12TH FRONT MEMBERS."

   HELICOPTERS CONTINUE OVERFLYING THE BATTLE ZONE.  AIRBORNE TROOPS
REPLACED THE TROOPS WHO WERE FIGHTING AGAINST THE MEN UP IN ARMS.

   PEASANTS WHO ARRIVED AT SAN VICENTE CHUCURRI SAID POWERFUL EXPLOSIONS
HAVE BEEN CONTINUOUSLY HEARD SINCE THE MILITARY ACTIONS BEGAN ON 22 MARCH.

   ARMY OFFICERS BELIEVE THE REBEL COLUMN IS SURROUNDED IN A MOUNTAINOUS
STRIP LOCATED BETWEEN EL CARMEN AND SAN VICENTE CHUCURRI MUNICIPALITIES.

   GEN VACA PERILLA RETURNED TO THE AREA YESTERDAY, BUT HE DID NOT MAKE ANY
STATEMENTS.  HE HAS BEEN COMMANDING OPERATIONS IN THE AREA FOR THE LAST 5

MURDER ARE NOT "SOLDIERS OR LIEUTENANTS," BUT ARE "MUCH HIGHER IN THE
HIERARCHY."

   "REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT WAS A GENERAL OR COLONEL, WHOEVER MASTERMINDED
THIS CRIME MUST BE PUNISHED," THE RANKING LEADER OF THE RULING ARENA
[NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] PARTY AND RETIRED OFFICER SAID DURING A
TELEVISED INTERVIEW. 

   THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS MULTIPLE MURDER THAT TOOK PLACE ON 16 NOVEMBER
"ARE NOT SOLDIERS OR LIEUTENANTS," HE SAID.

   "THIS ACTION INVOLVED MUCH HIGHER LEVEL OFFICERS, AND EVEN IF A GENERAL OR
COLONEL IS INVOLVED, (THE CULPRITS) MUST BE PUNISHED," HE POINTED OUT.

   HE ADDED: "WE HOPE THAT IT WILL NOT BE AS IN THE PAST WHEN THE MASTERMINDS
ARE PROTECTED.  AS THE SAYING GOES: THE LITTLE GUYS ALWAYS PAY."

   OCHOA SAID THAT HE IS CONVINCED THAT "INVESTIGATIONS MUST BE PURSUED" AND
THAT NOBODY SHOULD RECEIVE "SPECIAL TREATMENT," BECAUSE "UNFORTUNATELY,
THERE ARE ELEMENTS WHO ARE HURTING THE ARMY AND THE PRESIDENT, AND THE HIGH
COMMAND HAVE TO PURGE THEM."

   OCHOA, FORMER DEPUTY AND CURRENT PRESIDENT OF THE STATE POWER COMPANY,
DESCRIBED AS "COURAGEOUS" THE DECISION OF PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI TO
PUBLICLY ADMIT THAT MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES MASSACRED THE SIX JESUIT
PRIESTS AND TWO WOMEN.

   ON 7 JANUARY, CRISTIANI OFFICIALLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT MILITARY PERSONNEL
KILLED THE JESUITS, THEIR COOK, AND THE COOK'S 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER.

   HOWEVER, HE REFUSED TO REVEAL THE NAMES OF THOSE INVOLVED TO AVOID
HAMPERING THE INVESTIGATION.

   THE COLONEL SAID: "WE HOPE THAT THE NAMES WILL BE REVEALED SOON AND THAT
THESE PEOPLE WILL BE PUNISHED."

   OBSERVERS BELIEVE THAT OCHOA'S STATEMENTS, WHICH MIGHT SUGGEST AN INTERNAL
STRUGGLE WITHIN THE RULING ARENA, EXPRESS AN IMPLICIT WISH TO SEE THIS
ABOMINABLE CRIME RESOLVED."

   THE RETIRED COLONEL ADDED THAT THE "COURAGEOUS" POSITION OF CRISTIANI
REGARDING THIS CASE HAS BROUGHT HIM STRONG INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT THAT IS
HELPING TO STRENGTHEN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS THAT THE CURRENT PRESIDENT
WANTS TO PROMOTE.

   ALTHOUGH OCHOA ADMITTED THAT IN EL SALVADOR MILITARY POWER HAS BEEN BEHIND
THE REAL POWER AND THAT TRYING A MILITARY MAN HAS BEEN TABOO, HE SAID THAT
CRISTIANI "IS DETERMINED TO INTENSIFY A PURGE OF SUCH ELEMENTS FROM THE
ARMED FORCES."

   HE ALSO ADMITTED "THAT THERE ARE STILL SALVADORAN MILITARY MEN WHO BELIEVE
THAT THEY HOLD POWER AND THAT THEY CAN USE THEIR RIFLES AND THE POWER THAT
THEIR WEAPONS GIVE THEM."

   ROME (ITALY), 11 JAN 90 -- [INTERVIEW WITH DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE
LEADER RUBEN ZAMORA BY ALESSANDRO OPPES] [EXCERPT] [PASSAGE OMITTED]
[OPPES] THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] HAS
DESCRIBED THE ARREST OF FIVE SOLDIERS ACCUSED OF COMMITTING THE
MASSACRE [OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS] AS "A MANIPULATED COVER OPERATION."
BASICALLY, CRISTIANI IS ALLEGED TO HAVE DECIDED TO PUNISH A NUMBER OF
LOW-RANKING OFFICERS TO CLOSE THE CASE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND TO
END INTERNATIONAL PRESSURES.  WHAT IS YOUR OPINION IN THIS REGARD?

   [ZAMORA] THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT CRISTIANI ACKNOWLEDGES THAT MEMBERS OF
THE ARMY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MASSACRE IS A FIRST STEP AND DEFINITELY A
GOOD THING, BUT IT IS ENTIRELY INSUFFICIENT UNLESS THE SUBSEQUENT STEPS ARE
ALSO TAKEN.  FIRST, TO IDENTIFY WHO THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WERE:  THIS IS
THE FIRST IMPORTANT POINT, BECAUSE NOBODY CAN FEEL SATISFIED IF ONLY
LOW-RANKING OFFICERS ARE IDENTIFIED.  SUCH AN ACT CAN ONLY HAVE BEEN ORDERED
BY HIGH-RANKING OFFICERS.  WE MUST NOT FORGET THE MURDER OF MONSIGNOR ROMERO,
FOR WHICH THERE WERE NO SENTENCES AND NO TRIALS.

   [OPPES] HOWEVER, THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND IMMEDIATELY DENIED
INVOLVEMENT IN THE OPERATION, STATING THAT IT WAS AN ISOLATED ACTION
"DIVORCED FROM ANY INSTITUTIONAL POLICY."

   [ZAMORA] I BELIEVE THIS IS ENTIRELY WRONG: THE MURDER OF THE JESUIT
FATHERS CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AN ISOLATED ACTION.  OVER 7,000 PEOPLE HAVE
DIED IN EL SALVADOR DURING 10 YEARS OF CIVIL WAR, AND 90 PERCENT OF THEM WERE
CIVILIANS.  POLITICAL ASSASSINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT FORCES IS A CONSTANT
PRACTICE.  FURTHERMORE, TORTURE IS REGULARLY PRACTISED IN EL SALVADOR.  THE
ARMY HIGH COMMAND CANNOT FAIL TO KNOW THIS.  THEY CANNOT CLAIM TO BE
INNOCENT, BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE GREATEST RESPONSIBILITIES FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
VIOLATIONS.

   [OPPES] YET LAST MONTH THE SUMMIT OF CENTRAL AMERICAN HEADS OF STATE IN
SAN JOSE ENDED WITH A SUCCESS FOR PRESIDENT CRISTIANI, WHO SECURED AN
EXPLICIT CONDEMNATION OF THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE GUERRILLAS IN
NOVEMBER, WHEREAS NO SPECIFIC CHARGES WERE LEVELED AT THE GOVERNMENT FOR
HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.

   [ZAMORA] THERE IS A POSITIVE FACTOR THAT SHOULD BE BORNE IN MIND, NAMELY,
THE CALL FROM THE FIVE PRESIDENTS FOR A RESUMPTION OF THE DIALOGUE IN EL
SALVADOR AND THE APPEAL TO THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL TO CARRY OUT MEDIATION
TO THIS END.  BUT IN THE SUMMIT'S FINAL DOCUMENT, IT IS THE FMLN AND THE
NICARAGUAN CONTRAS WHO PAY THE PRICE FOR THE AGREEMENT AMONG THE PRESIDENTS:
THESE ARE DIPLOMATIC GAMES THAT DO NOT FACILITATE THE RESTORATION OF PEACE
IN CENTRAL AMERICA.

   [OPPES] WHAT PATHS CAN BE TAKEN NOW TO ADVANCE THE NEGOTIATIONS?

   [ZAMORA] NEGOTIATIONS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY NECESSARY.  THE GUERRILLA
OFFENSIVE SHOWS THAT THE FMLN IS A STRONG MILITARY FORCE, BUT ALSO THAT A
REVOLUTIONARY ATTITUDE DOES NOT EXIST AMONG THE MASSES.  IT ALSO SHOWS THAT
THE GOVERNMENT ARMY, AFTER 10 YEARS OF U.S. TRAINING, IS AN ARMY WHOSE
MILITARY STANCE IS DEFENSIVE, NOT OFFENSIVE (WHICH IS THE KEY TO U.S.
MILITARY STRATEGY.)  WHILE THIS ALL SHOWS THAT THERE CAN ONLY BE A
NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS, IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT PRECISELY FOLLOWING
THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE (AND THIS IS THE PARADOX) THE ARMY STIFFENED ITS
STANCE AGAINST NEGOTIATIONS.  I BELIEVE THAT SOONER OR LATER COMMON SENSE
WILL PREVAIL AND IT WILL SIT DOWN AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE.  AT THE END OF
NOVEMBER THE U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE'S ASSISTANT FOR LATIN AMERICA SPOKE
OFFICIALLY FOR THE FIRST TIME ABOUT THE NEED FOR NEGOTIATIONS TO RESOLVE THE

   TEGUCIGALPA, 26 JAN 89 -- [INTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT JOSE AZCONA BY JULIO
ARMANDO VALDES] [EXCERPT] [AZCONA] ...WHICH HAS DISMAYED ALL HONDURAN
PEOPLE.  THE GOVERNMENT STRONGLY CONDEMNS THIS KIND OF ACTION--THE MURDER
OF [RETIRED] GENERAL GUSTAVO ALVAREZ MARTINEZ--WHICH WAS POLITICALLY
MOTIVATED AND PERPETRATED BY PROFESSIONALS, AND WHICH, I BELIEVE, DESERVES
THE DENUNCIATION OF ALL HONDURANS.

   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, WILL THE THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT AND THE
ARMED FORCES ADOPT ADDITIONAL SECURITY MEASURES?

   [AZCONA] YES, WE WILL BE DISCUSSING THAT SOON.  I HAVE A MEETING
SCHEDULED WITH THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, WHICH WILL ALSO BE
ATTENDED BY THE THREE PRESIDENTS OF THE STATE BRANCHES.  I MEAN, THE
[WORDS INDISTINCT] WILL CHAIR THE MEETING, AND NATIONAL CONGRESS
PRESIDENT CARLOS ARBIN MONTOYA AND SUPREME COURT PRESIDENT SALOMON
JIMENEZ CASTRO WILL ALSO ATTEND.  WE HAVE ALSO INVITED THE CANDIDATES
OF THE TWO [NUMBER AS HEARD] PARTIES TO THIS MEETING SINCE ONE OF THEM
IS GOING TO BE THE NEXT HONDURAN PRESIDENT.  WE PLAN TO ESTABLISH SOME
GUIDELINE--SOME RULES TO BE FOLLOWED--NOT JUST FOR THE REMAINDER OF
OUR TERM BUT IN THE FUTURE AS WELL, BECAUSE WE SHOULD BE FARSIGHTED
AND NOT JUST CONCENTRATE ON THE SHORT TERM, WHICH HAS BEEN VERY COMMON
IN HONDURAS, WHERE WE LOOK AND FIND SOLUTIONS ONLY FOR THE PRESENT.
WE SHOULD FIND SOLUTIONS JOINTLY [WORDS INDISTINCT] IN THE LONG RUN,
WHICH INCLUDES THE ISSUE OF VIOLENCE.  WE BELIEVE IN A DEMOCRACY LIKE
OURS, WHICH IS A VERY COMPLETE DEMOCRACY.  IN OTHER WORDS, THERE ARE
INTERNAL ELECTIONS FOR SELECTING CANDIDATES, WHERE CITIZENS ENJOY FULL
RIGHTS, WHERE PARTIES AND PARTY LEADERS CONSULT WITH THE PEOPLE, WHERE
WE HAVE TRUE, CLEAN, AND HONEST ELECTIONS, WHERE WE HAVE A NATIONAL
ELECTORAL COMMISSION THAT IS NOT INFLUENCED BY NOR CAN IT BE
INFLUENCED BY THE GOVERNMENT, AND WHERE THE STATE BRANCHES ARE TOTALLY
INDEPENDENT.

   ALL OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS MAKE HONDURAS A DEMOCRACY, AND EVERY
SECTOR OF HONDURAN SOCIETY SHOULD STRIVE TO STRENGTHEN THEM BY AVOIDING
VIOLENCE AT ALL COSTS, OBEYING THE LAW, AND CONDEMNING AND ATTACKING
EXTREME TERRORIST GROUPS REGARDLESS OF THEIR AFFILIATION, THUS ENABLING US
TO CONSOLIDATE OUR DEMOCRACY AND REACH THE LEVEL OF POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT
ATTAINED BY OTHER DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES.

   IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED WORLDWIDE THAT PROGRESS AND DEVELOPMENT CAN
ONLY BE ACHIEVED THROUGH DEMOCRACY.  THE FRG, THE MEDITERRANEAN
COUNTRIES--ITALY, FRANCE, AND SPAIN--ARE EXAMPLES OF THIS, AND THERE IS
THE CASE OF JAPAN, WHICH HAS A LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM AND HAS ACHIEVED
EXTRAORDINARY LEVELS OF DEVELOPMENT.  TAIWAN IS YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE.  AT
THIS STAGE...

   [VALDES, INTERRUPTING] YES, BUT THIS TAKES TIME.

   [AZCONA] YES.  AT THIS STAGE I BELIEVE THERE IS SUFFICIENT PROOF THAT
THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM IS THE BEST MEANS OF ATTAINING HIGHER LEVELS OF
DEVELOPMENT.  THERE IS NO DOUBT IN ANYONE'S MIND ABOUT THAT, BUT THE FACT
THAT WE HAVE THIS SYSTEM IS NOT ENOUGH.  EACH ONE OF US, EACH SECTOR, MUST
DO HIS PART TO MAKE IT WORK.

   WHEN I MENTION SECTORS, I AM REFERRING TO PRIVATE ENTERPRISE, WHICH
MUST BE GENEROUS, EXHIBIT CONFIDENCE IN THE COUNTRY, AND SHOW MUCH
INITIATIVE; TO ORGANIZED LABOR GROUPS, WHICH MUST FIGHT FOR THEIR RIGHTS
WITHOUT FOMENTING STRIKES AND OTHER DISORDERS, WHICH ARE SOMETIMES BROUGHT
ABOUT ILLEGALLY INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING THE NORMAL LEGAL PROCEDURES; TO
PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, WHICH ALSO HAVE AN ENORMOUS RESPONSIBILITY,
BECAUSE THEIR MEMBERS MUST COMPLY WITH THEIR DUTIES; AND THE SAME GOES FOR
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES AND OTHERS.

   IN OTHER WORDS, THIS WILL NOT BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THIS OR THE NEXT
GOVERNMENT ALONE.  OUR GOVERNMENTS ARE TRANSITORY AND THEIR POWER IS
RELATIVE.  I HAVE SAID THIS MANY TIMES.  THERE IS NO POINT IN LASHING OUT
AT THE PRESIDENT, BECAUSE POWER IN HONDURAS IS RELATIVE AND CONDITIONAL.
WHAT IS ESSENTIAL IS TO CONTRIBUTE POSITIVELY TOWARD HONDURAS'
DEVELOPMENT.  THIS SHOULD BE A RESPONSIBILITY NOT ONLY OF PUBLIC
EMPLOYEES, BUSINESSMEN, WORKERS, AND ORGANIZED PEASANTS, BUT ALL HONDURANS
SHOULD CONTRIBUTE.  THAT IS WHAT COUNTS.

   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, WHEN WILL THIS MEETING BE HELD AND WHAT IMMEDIATE
MEASURES WILL YOU PROPOSE?

   [AZCONA] THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES ARE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO
INVESTIGATE THE LATEST CRIME, WHICH WAS NOT AN EVERYDAY OCCURRENCE LIKE A
ROBBERY OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE.  THIS CRIME WAS CAREFULLY PLANNED.  IT
WAS A TERRORIST ACT PERPETRATED BY PROFESSIONALS.

   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT THE DEATH
PENALTY MIGHT BE A WAY TO COPE WITH THE SITUATION.  WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THIS?

   [AZCONA] I RECENTLY READ SOMETHING ABOUT THE DEATH PENALTY IN A MEXICAN
MAGAZINE.  THE DEATH PENALTY IS OPPOSED BY A MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE AND HAS
BEEN ABOLISHED IN HONDURAS.  I DO NOT THINK THIS IS THE SOLUTION HERE
BECAUSE THE DEATH PENALTY HAS NOT SOLVED THE CRIME PROBLEM ANYWHERE ELSE IN
THE WORLD.  FOR INSTANCE, THIS PENALTY EXISTS IN MANY U.S. STATES, BUT THIS
HAS NOT DETERRED CRIMINALS FROM COMMITTING TERRIBLE CRIMES.  PEOPLE HAVE
LOST CONTROL.  WHEN CRIMINALS HAVE NO RESPECT FOR THEIR FELLOW MAN, NOT
EVEN THE DEATH PENALTY CAN STOP THEM.  HOWEVER, THERE ARE CRIMES, SUCH AS
DRUG TRAFFICKING, FOR WHICH NO BAIL SHOULD BE PERMITTED.  I THINK A BILL
THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED BY THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE SHOULD BE PASSED BY
THE CONGRESS.  OF COURSE, IT WILL BE APPROVED BY THE PRESIDENT SO THOSE
FOUND GUILTY OF THIS CRIME CANNOT BE BAILED OUT.  IT IS NOT RIGHT FOR THE
AUTHORITIES TO ARREST A DRUG TRAFFICKER ONLY TO SEE HIM RELEASED ON BAIL
BY A JUDGE WHO HAS NO OTHER CHOICE THAN TO ABIDE BY THE LAW.

   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, THE FAR RIGHTIST GROUP AAA [ANTICOMMUNIST ACTION
ALLIANCE], THROUGH A LOCAL RADIO STATION, WARNED THAT THEY WILL TAKE
REVENGE ON MAJOR COMMUNIST LEADERS, SUCH AS JORGE ARTURO REINA, RAMON
CUSTODIO, AND OTHERS.  WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS?

   [AZCONA] I AM ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO THIS TYPE OF REVENGE BECAUSE IT WOULD
ONLY LEAD TO ESCALATED CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN GROUPS.  I CONDEMN THIS
ATTITUDE IN VIEW OF THE REGRETTABLE MURDER OF GENERAL GUSTAVO ALVAREZ
MARTINEZ.  AS FAR AS THE DEATH PENALTY GOES, IT WILL NOT BE A SOLUTION TO
THE CRIME PROBLEM.

   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, CIVIC COMMITTEES HAVE TO BE ORGANIZED IN THE
COUNTRY.

   [AZCONA] I AGREE, BUT THESE COMMITTEES SHOULD BE CONTROLLED BY THE
AUTHORITIES.  A CIVIC COMMITTEE TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES IS ONE THING, BUT IT
IS QUITE ANOTHER THING TO SUE THESE COMMITTEES TO PERFORM DUTIES THAT ARE
ALREADY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF STATE AGENCIES, SUCH AS THE ARMED FORCES.

   [VALDES] WHEN WILL THE GOVERNMENT BRANCHES MEET?

   [AZCONA] THEY WILL MEET WHEN I RETURN FROM CARACAS.

LATER.  THEY ARE PERFECTLY SAFE AND SOUND.

   [REPORTER] WHERE WERE THEY KEPT?  CAN YOU DESCRIBE IT?

   [OTALORA] NO, I CANNOT GIVE YOU DETAILS RIGHT NOW.  WE WILL PROBABLY

"SALVADORAN PARAMILITARY GROUPS" ARE CARRYING OUT ACTIONS IN THIS COUNTRY.

PARAMILITARY GROUPS OF BOTH COUNTRIES," BECAUSE THE PERPETRATORS KNEW OF
OQUELI'S ARRIVAL "AND THEY STAGED AN ENTIRE OPERATION TO KIDNAP HIM."

SHOTS THROUGH THE TEMPLE IN THE GUATEMALAN TOWN OF JALPATAGUA, NEAR THE

   SAN SALVADOR, 6 FEB 89 -- [REPORT] [MARCO ANTONIO GUEVARA] [TEXT] ON A
NATIONAL RADIO AND TELEVISION NETWORK LAST NIGHT, THE GOVERNMENT REVEALED
THE RESULTS OF A NUMBER OF INVESTIGATIONS ON THE MURDER OF MSGR ARNULFO
ROMERO; HOWEVER, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID AT NOON TODAY ONLY THE FOURTH
CRIMINAL COURT JUDGE CAN DETERMINE WHETHER THE EVIDENCE AGAINST ANY PERSON
IS LEGAL:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERTO GARCIAL ALVARADO] SINCE I
DO NOT KNOW THEIR CONTENT, I CANNOT GIVE AN OPINION ON THE MATTER.
HOWEVER, IF FROM THOSE RECORDS OR THE VIDEO ONE CAN DETERMINE THERE IS
SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO SOLVE THE CRIME COMMITTED AGAINST MSGR ROMERO, I
WILL UNQUESTIONABLY REQUEST THAT EVIDENCE AND SUBMIT IT IMMEDIATELY TO THE
FOURTH CRIMINAL COURT.  I BELIEVE EVIDENCE SHOULD NOT BE USED TO SPECULATE
OR SHOULD NOT BE PUBLICLY PROMOTED.  IF PERTINENT EVIDENCE EXISTS, IT MUST
BE SUBMITTED TO THE CORRESPONDING JUDGE, WHO IS THE EXCLUSIVE LEGAL
AUTHORITY TO DEAL WITH IT AND, AFTER AN EXHAUSTIVE ANALYSIS, DETERMINE THE
VALIDITY OF THE EVIDENCE. [END RECORDING]

   NEVERTHELESS, MSGR ROMERO'S CASE HAS BEGUN TO HAVE THE ELEMENTS IT HAD
LACKED FOR MORE THAN 8 YEARS.  THE LEGAL EVIDENCE MUST CONTAIN A SERIES OF
CONDITIONS, AND ONLY THE JUDGE CAN DETERMINE WHETHER THEY HAVE VALUE OR
NOT.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERTO GARCIAL ALVARADO] THE VIDEO
FOR EXAMPLE IS NOT EVIDENCE.  THE CONTENTS OF THE VIDEO MUST BE REAFFIRMED
BY THE PERSONS WHO IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER PARTICIPATED IN THE PREPARATION,
AND THE ACCURACY OF THE CONTENTS NARRATED IN THAT VIDEO MUST BE LEGALLY
DETERMINED. [END RECORDING]

   GARCIA ALVARADO ADDED THAT THE FOURTH CRIMINAL COURT JUDGE DECIDED A FEW
HOURS AGO TO SUMMON FORMER ATTORNEY ROBERTO GIRON FLORES AND THE OFFICIALS
JULIO ALFREDO SAMAYOA AND GERARDO LE CHEVALIER TO GIVE THE EVIDENCE THEY
CLAIM TO HAVE ON THE CASE.  BECAUSE THEY ARE OFFICIALS, THE LATTER TWO MUST
MAKE SWORN STATEMENTS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERTO GARCIAL ALVARADO] THE JUDGE
IN CHARGE OF THE CASE HAS ISSUED RESOLUTIONS ORDERING THE SUMMONS OF IVON
FLORES AND SWORN STATEMENTS FROM THE TWO OFFICIALS MENTIONED. [END
RECORDING]

   THESE NEW RESOLUTIONS OF THE FOURTH CRIMINAL COURT JUDGE ON MSGR
ROMERO'S CASE WERE ISSUED AT THE REQUEST OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE,
WHICH DEMONSTRATES, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID, THAT HE IS NOT AN
UNDERTAKER OF TRIALS, MUCH LESS OF PEOPLE.

   VICE PRESIDENT ANTONIO CASTILLO CLARAMOUNT SAID THE SUPREME COURT OF
JUSTICE HAS THE MORAL OBLIGATION TO PUNISH THE MURDERERS OF MSGR ROMERO,
INCLUDING MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON.  THE VICE PRESIDENT ALSO INSISTED THE
LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO SEE THAT THOSE GUILTY OF THE
MURDER OF MSGR ROMERO BE PUNISHED.  HOWEVER, HE STRESSED THE SUPREME COURT
MUST ACT.  HE SAID THE INVESTIGATION MUST CONTINUE AND GATHER ALL THE
EVIDENCE TO SOLVE THIS CASE, WHICH OCCURRED IN MARCH 1980.

   SAN SALVADOR, 10 JAN 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] A GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN HAS
ANNOUNCED THAT WITHIN THE NEXT 72 HOURS THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WILL
DISCLOSE THE NAMES OF THE INDIVIDUALS IMPLICATED IN THE MURDER OF SIX
JESUITS, IF THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE NOT "HINDERED."

   IN A BRIEF STATEMENT TO THE PRESS, MAURICIO SANDOVAL SAID THAT SALVADORAN
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI WILL, WITHIN THE PERIOD STATED, ANNOUNCE "THE
NAMES OF THE INDIVIDUALS" WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE MULTIPLE CRIME PERPETRATED
ON 16 NOVEMBER AT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY IN SAN SALVADOR.

   CRISTIANI ANNOUNCED ON SUNDAY THAT "MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES"
PARTICIPATED IN THE CRIME, AND THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WILL BRING THOSE
INDIVIDUALS TO JUSTICE IN EL SALVADOR, "REGARDLESS OF WHOM THEY MAY BE."

   SANDOVAL POINTED OUT THAT "MORE THAN SEVEN PEOPLE WERE INVOLVED IN THE
MURDER, AND TWO PERPETRATED IT."  HE ADDED THAT TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS ACTED,
ONE THAT MURDERED THE CLERGYMEN AND ANOTHER THAT MURDERED TWO MAIDS,
ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY RESULTS ISSUED BY THE CRIME COMMISSION IN CHARGE OF
SOLVING THE CASE.

   "THERE WAS NO TORTURE OR MISTREATMENT, BUT WORDS WERE EXCHANGED" BETWEEN
THE MURDERERS AND VICTIMS, THE SPOKESMAN SAID, ADDING THAT FIVE OF THE
MURDERED JESUITS HAD RECEIVED "FINISHING SHOTS," ACCORDING TO AUTOPSIES
CARRIED OUT BY SALVADORAN FORENSIC DOCTORS.

   ACCORDING TO TESTIMONY THE COMMISSION GATHERED FROM 115 MEMBERS OF THE
ARMY AND 103 CIVILIANS, THE MURDER TOOK PLACE BETWEEN 0200 AND 0300, AND
THERE WERE "EXPLOSIONS, MACHINE-GUN BLASTS, AND SHOTS," SANDOVAL SAID.

   THE SPOKESMAN ADDED THAT 2 OFFICERS AND 45 SOLDIERS HAVE BEEN "CONFINED IN
VARIOUS HEADQUARTERS PENDING INVESTIGATION."

   AT LEAST 230 CARTRIDGES OF VARIOUS CALIBER, INCLUDING SOME FOR SOVIET MADE
AK-47'S, M-79 ANTITANK WEAPONS, AND M-67 GRENADES, WERE FOUND AT THE SITE OF
THE MURDER, THE OFFICIAL SAID.



DEV-MUC3-0062 (NOSC)

   SAN SALVADOR, 6 FEB 89 -- [TEXT] JUSTICE MINISTER JULIO ALFREDO SAMAYOA
SAID TODAY ALL THE EVIDENCE GATHERED BY THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS
COMMISSION DEMONSTRATES THAT DR ANTONIO REGALADO WAS THE PERPETRATOR OF
THE MURDER OF MSGR ROMERO.

   IN HIS CAPACITY AS CHAIRMAN OF THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS COMMISSION,
DR JULIO ALFREDO SAMAYOA REPORTED TODAY IN DETAIL ON THE MURDER OF MSGR
OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO.  DR SAMAYOA SAID TO CLARIFY THE CASE, THE COMMISSION
HAS CONDUCTED 238 MEETINGS, OVER 100 INQUIRIES, AND 21 DEPOSITIONS.  HE
ADDED THAT THE INVESTIGATION WAS CARRIED OUT UNDER THE NAME OF "OPERATION
PINEAPPLE" AND THAT IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON WAS THE
MASTERMIND AND DR ANTONIO REGALADO WAS THE PERPETRATOR.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [SAMAYOA] THERE IS NO DOUBT.  ALL THE INVESTIGATIONS
CARRIED OUT BY THE COMMISSION POINT TO MAJ ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON AS THE
MASTERMIND.  THIS HAS TO BE PROVEN IN COURT.  HOWEVER, HE HAS PARLIAMENTARY
IMMUNITY; HE CANNOT BE BROUGHT TO COURT.  THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN
ALLIANCE [ARENA] HAS THE MAJORITY IN THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, AND ARENA IS
NOT GOING TO PERMIT A DECLARATION THAT WILL BRING HIS CASE TO COURT. [END
RECORDING]

   DR SAMAYOA ALSO SAID HE IS WILLING TO PRESENT ALL THE EVIDENCE HE HAS
ON THE CASE.  HOWEVER, HE SAID HE DID NOT TRUST THE BEHAVIOR OF THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE REPUBLIC:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [SAMAYOA] WE WILL PRESENT THE EVIDENCE.  I THINK THEY
ARE GOING TO BE SORRY THEY MADE THAT REQUEST, BECAUSE MANY PERSONS ARE
INVOLVED.  SINCE THEIR PARTICIPATION HAS NOT YET BEEN PROVEN, THESE NAMES
HAVE NOT YET BEEN RELEASED.  HOWEVER, WHEN WE PRESENT THE ENTIRE DOSSIER TO
THE COURTS, THESE NAMES ARE GOING TO COME UP.  THEN SOME WILL JUDGE AND
DECIDE IF THEY PARTICIPATED OR NOT.  BUT THEIR NAMES ARE THERE, AS ARE
THEIR ACTIVITIES AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS TO THE DEATH SQUADS.  MANY
PERSONS WHO ARE MENTIONED ARE APPARENTLY RESPECTABLE, AND I MEAN
RESPECTABLE IN QUOTES.  [END RECORDING]

   THE ASSASSINATION OF MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO TOOK PLACE ON 24 MARCH
1980; ACCORDING TO THE OFFICIAL, THE INVESTIGATIONS HAVE TAKEN 9 YEARS
BECAUSE MANY PERSONS CONSIDERED KEY WITNESSES HAVE DIED SINCE THE TIME OF
THE MURDER.  HOWEVER, HE ADDED, WITH THE COOPERATION OF THE FBI AS WELL AS
SOME CENTRAL AMERICAN INVESTIGATION ORGANIZATIONS, THE CASE HAS BEEN
CLARIFIED, WHICH MIGHT LEAD TO THE IMPRISONMENT OF MAJ D'AUBUISSON ONCE HE
LOSES HIS PARLIAMENTARY IMMUNITY.

   SAN SALVADOR, 9 JAN 90 (DPA) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN ARMY TODAY
PREVENTED THE OCCUPATION OF CITIES IN THE EASTERN PART OF EL SALVADOR,
WAGING STRONG CLASHES BETWEEN MIDNIGHT AND DAWN, ACCORDING TO REPORTS BY
MILITARY SOURCES.

   THE ATTACKS, ACCORDING TO THE REPORTS, TOOK PLACE IN USULUTAN, USULUTAN
DEPARTMENT, 110 KM EAST OF THE CAPITAL, AND IN SANTA ELENA WHERE AS OF 0700
CLASHES WERE STILL UNDER WAY.  SANTA ELENA IS LOCATED 119 KM EAST OF THE
CAPITAL, AND BOTH CITIES ARE COFFEE REGIONS.

   IN USULUTAN, 6TH BRIGADE TROOPS AND RAPID DEPLOYMENT BATTALIONS REPELLED
THE INCURSION WITH ARTILLERY FIRE.  DURING THE 2D WEEK OF DECEMBER, THERE HAD
BEEN STRONG CLASHES ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF USULUTAN, IN WHAT THE GUERRILLAS
CALLED THE "BATTLE OF EL NISPERAL," IN THE CANTON THAT BEARS THE SAME NAME,
WHICH COST THE ARMY 29 DEAD, ALTHOUGH IT HAS ONLY ADMITTED TO 21 DEATHS.

   IN SANTA ELENA THE CLASHES WERE ALSO STRONG, BUT SO FAR THERE HAVE BEEN NO
REPORTS OF CASUALTIES ON EITHER SIDE.

   FROM SAN VICENTE, IN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE COUNTRY, WHERE THE
CHICHONTEPEC VOLCANO IS LOCATED, STRONG CLASHES WERE REPORTED, AND THE 5TH
BRIGADE BOMBED REBEL POSITIONS ON THE COLCANO, WHERE THE FMLN HAS STRONG
BASTIONS.

   THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE IS CARRYING OUT OPERATIONS IN NORTHERN SAN
SALVADOR.  AND ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE CAPITAL THIS MORNING POWERFUL
EXPLOSIONS, CHARACTERIZED AS MILITARY ACTIONS TO PREVENT REBELS FROM
GATHERING, COULD BE HEARD.  THE NIGHT BEFORE LAST, THERE WERE ATTEMPTS TO
ENTER THE CAPITAL FROM THAT DIRECTION.

   THE ARMY HAS INCREASED ITS SURVEILLANCE TO PREVENT MOBILIZATIONS, AND
THROUGH CAREFUL SEARCHES VEHICLES ARE BEING CONTROLLED AT THE CAPITAL CITY'S
ENTRANCES AND EXITS.

   IN OTHER ACTIONS, THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE REPORTED AT LEAST SIX
FMLN DEATHS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.

   LAST NIGHT THERE WERE FEWER ATTACKS ON STORES AND ELECTRIC TOWERS IN THE
CAPITAL.  THERE WERE ALSO THREATS OF POWER RATIONING IF THESE ACTIONS
CONTINUED.
