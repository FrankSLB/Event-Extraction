   SAN SALVADOR, 9 JAN 90 (DPA) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN ARMY TODAY
PREVENTED THE OCCUPATION OF CITIES IN THE EASTERN PART OF EL SALVADOR,
WAGING STRONG CLASHES BETWEEN MIDNIGHT AND DAWN, ACCORDING TO REPORTS BY
MILITARY SOURCES.

   THE ATTACKS, ACCORDING TO THE REPORTS, TOOK PLACE IN USULUTAN, USULUTAN
DEPARTMENT, 110 KM EAST OF THE CAPITAL, AND IN SANTA ELENA WHERE AS OF 0700
CLASHES WERE STILL UNDER WAY.  SANTA ELENA IS LOCATED 119 KM EAST OF THE
CAPITAL, AND BOTH CITIES ARE COFFEE REGIONS.

   IN USULUTAN, 6TH BRIGADE TROOPS AND RAPID DEPLOYMENT BATTALIONS REPELLED
THE INCURSION WITH ARTILLERY FIRE.  DURING THE 2D WEEK OF DECEMBER, THERE HAD
BEEN STRONG CLASHES ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF USULUTAN, IN WHAT THE GUERRILLAS
CALLED THE "BATTLE OF EL NISPERAL," IN THE CANTON THAT BEARS THE SAME NAME,
WHICH COST THE ARMY 29 DEAD, ALTHOUGH IT HAS ONLY ADMITTED TO 21 DEATHS.

   IN SANTA ELENA THE CLASHES WERE ALSO STRONG, BUT SO FAR THERE HAVE BEEN NO
REPORTS OF CASUALTIES ON EITHER SIDE.

   FROM SAN VICENTE, IN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE COUNTRY, WHERE THE
CHICHONTEPEC VOLCANO IS LOCATED, STRONG CLASHES WERE REPORTED, AND THE 5TH
BRIGADE BOMBED REBEL POSITIONS ON THE COLCANO, WHERE THE FMLN HAS STRONG
BASTIONS.

   THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE IS CARRYING OUT OPERATIONS IN NORTHERN SAN
SALVADOR.  AND ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE CAPITAL THIS MORNING POWERFUL
EXPLOSIONS, CHARACTERIZED AS MILITARY ACTIONS TO PREVENT REBELS FROM
GATHERING, COULD BE HEARD.  THE NIGHT BEFORE LAST, THERE WERE ATTEMPTS TO
ENTER THE CAPITAL FROM THAT DIRECTION.

   THE ARMY HAS INCREASED ITS SURVEILLANCE TO PREVENT MOBILIZATIONS, AND
THROUGH CAREFUL SEARCHES VEHICLES ARE BEING CONTROLLED AT THE CAPITAL CITY'S
ENTRANCES AND EXITS.

   IN OTHER ACTIONS, THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE REPORTED AT LEAST SIX
FMLN DEATHS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.

   LAST NIGHT THERE WERE FEWER ATTACKS ON STORES AND ELECTRIC TOWERS IN THE
CAPITAL.  THERE WERE ALSO THREATS OF POWER RATIONING IF THESE ACTIONS
CONTINUED.

   SAN SALVADOR, 10 JAN 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] A GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN HAS
ANNOUNCED THAT WITHIN THE NEXT 72 HOURS THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WILL
DISCLOSE THE NAMES OF THE INDIVIDUALS IMPLICATED IN THE MURDER OF SIX
JESUITS, IF THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE NOT "HINDERED."

   IN A BRIEF STATEMENT TO THE PRESS, MAURICIO SANDOVAL SAID THAT SALVADORAN
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI WILL, WITHIN THE PERIOD STATED, ANNOUNCE "THE
NAMES OF THE INDIVIDUALS" WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE MULTIPLE CRIME PERPETRATED
ON 16 NOVEMBER AT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY IN SAN SALVADOR.

   CRISTIANI ANNOUNCED ON SUNDAY THAT "MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES"
PARTICIPATED IN THE CRIME, AND THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WILL BRING THOSE
INDIVIDUALS TO JUSTICE IN EL SALVADOR, "REGARDLESS OF WHOM THEY MAY BE."

   SANDOVAL POINTED OUT THAT "MORE THAN SEVEN PEOPLE WERE INVOLVED IN THE
MURDER, AND TWO PERPETRATED IT."  HE ADDED THAT TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS ACTED,
ONE THAT MURDERED THE CLERGYMEN AND ANOTHER THAT MURDERED TWO MAIDS,
ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY RESULTS ISSUED BY THE CRIME COMMISSION IN CHARGE OF
SOLVING THE CASE.

   "THERE WAS NO TORTURE OR MISTREATMENT, BUT WORDS WERE EXCHANGED" BETWEEN
THE MURDERERS AND VICTIMS, THE SPOKESMAN SAID, ADDING THAT FIVE OF THE
MURDERED JESUITS HAD RECEIVED "FINISHING SHOTS," ACCORDING TO AUTOPSIES
CARRIED OUT BY SALVADORAN FORENSIC DOCTORS.

   ACCORDING TO TESTIMONY THE COMMISSION GATHERED FROM 115 MEMBERS OF THE
ARMY AND 103 CIVILIANS, THE MURDER TOOK PLACE BETWEEN 0200 AND 0300, AND
THERE WERE "EXPLOSIONS, MACHINE-GUN BLASTS, AND SHOTS," SANDOVAL SAID.

   THE SPOKESMAN ADDED THAT 2 OFFICERS AND 45 SOLDIERS HAVE BEEN "CONFINED IN
VARIOUS HEADQUARTERS PENDING INVESTIGATION."

   AT LEAST 230 CARTRIDGES OF VARIOUS CALIBER, INCLUDING SOME FOR SOVIET MADE
AK-47'S, M-79 ANTITANK WEAPONS, AND M-67 GRENADES, WERE FOUND AT THE SITE OF
THE MURDER, THE OFFICIAL SAID.

DEV-MUC3-0023 (NOSC)

   LIMA, 11 JAN 90 -- [TEXT] THE MRTA [TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT]
TODAY DISTRIBUTED LEAFLETS CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MURDER OF FORMER
DEFENSE MINISTER ENRIQUE LOPEZ ALBUJAR.

   GENERAL OSVALDO DIAZ SALVADOR, CHIEF OF THE 7TH SUBREGION OF THE NATIONAL
POLICE, HAS CONFIRMED THE EXISTENCE OF THE LEAFLETS, AND ADDED THAT THE
MURDER CASE IS STILL BEING INVESTIGATED.  HE SAID THAT AMONG THE THOUSANDS
OF DETAINEES THERE ARE 16 SUSPECTS WHO ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE PARTICIPATED IN
THE MURDER OF THE OUTSTANDING GENERAL.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [DIAZ SALVADOR] WELL, THERE ARE TWO OPERATIONS.  FIRST,
THE DRAGNET OPERATION, IN WHICH PEOPLE WITH THE CHARACTERISTICS ESTABLISHED
BY WITNESSES ARE ARRESTED, AND SECOND, THERE IS A MORE SPECIFIC OPERATION
BEING CONDUCTED BY THE SPECIALIZED UNITS.

   [REPORTER] IS THERE ANY INFORMATION YET REGARDING THE CAPTURE OF THE
MURDERERS OF THE FORMER DEFENSE MINISTER?

   [DIAZ SALVADOR] THESE OPERATIONS SEEK TO CLEAR UP BOTH A CRIME THAT HAS
SHOCKED THE NATION AND ALSO THE KILLING OF TWO PATROLMEN WHO WERE MURDERED
IN COLD BLOOD THE DAY BEFORE THE GENERAL WAS MURDERED.

   [REPORTER] DO THE POLICE HAVE IDENTIKITS OF THE MURDERERS?

   [DIAZ SALVADOR] WE HAVE RECEIVED SOME IDENTIKITS OF PEOPLE WHO COULD HAVE
PARTICIPATED IN THE ATTACK FROM THE SPECIALIZED UNITS OF THE TECHNICAL
POLICE.  BASED ON THESE IDENTIKITS THE POLICE WILL BE MORE SPECIFIC AND
SELECTIVE.

   [REPORTER] HOW MANY IDENTIKITS DO YOU HAVE SO FAR?

   [DIAZ SALVADOR] SO FAR WE HAVE RECEIVED THREE IDENTIKITS.

   [REPORTER] THE MURDER IS ATTRIBUTED TO MRTA AND NOT TO THE SHINING PATH.
WHAT NEWS DO THE HAVE ON THIS?

   [DIAZ SALVADOR] I BELIEVE THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES WILL HAVE THE FINAL
WORD ON THIS.

   [REPORTER] IS IT TRUE THAT THE MRTA HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE
MURDER?

   [DIAZ SALVADOR] WELL, WE ALL KNOW THAT SOME LEAFLETS HAVE APPEARED TODAY
INSIDE A NEWSPAPER THAT CLAIMS TO BE THE MOUTHPIECE ON THIS MATTER, BUT I DO
NOT THINK THIS IS FINAL.  [END RECORDING]

   CLANDESTINE, 12 JAN 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE] [NATIONAL
REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT, MNR] [TEXT] THE MNR REPORTS THE DISAPPEARANCE
AND KIDNAPPING OF MNR ASSISTANT SECRETARY GENERAL HECTOR OQUELI
COLINDRES IN GUATEMALA CITY TODAY, 12 JANUARY.

   OQUELI ARRIVED IN GUATEMALA ON 11 JANUARY.  HE HAD PLANNED TO TRAVEL TO
NICARAGUA EARLY ON 12 JANUARY TO JOIN A SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL DELEGATION
IN THAT COUNTRY.  FROM NICARAGUA HE WOULD TRAVEL TO QUITO, ECUADOR, TO
ATTEND A CONVENTION OF THE SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR LATIN
AMERICA, OF WHICH OQUELI IS SECRETARY.

   ACCORDING TO REPORTS, OQUELI AND HIS COMPANION GILDA FLORES, A MEMBER OF
THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF GUATEMALA, WERE ABDUCTED BY HEAVILY ARMED MEN
BETWEEN 0630 AND 0700 AS THEY WERE HEADING TO LA AURORA AIRPORT TO BOARD
THEIR FLIGHT.

   WE URGE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, PARTICULARLY THE DEMOCRATIC
GOVERNMENTS OF THE WORLD, TO DEMAND THE IMMEDIATE RELEASE OF HECTOR OQUELI
AND HIS COMPANION, AS WELL AS A TOTAL CLARIFICATION OF THIS ATTACK.

   SAN SALVADOR, 13 JAN 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN OPPOSITION
NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MNR) TODAY DEMANDED THAT GUATEMALAN
PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO "THOROUGHLY" INVESTIGATE THE ASSASSINATION OF MNR
LEADER HECTOR OQUELI AND OF GUATEMALAN ATTORNEY GILDA FLORES.

   DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE, THE MNR EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE CONDEMNED THE
"ABOMINABLE" CRIME PERPETRATED ON 12 JANUARY IN GUATEMALA BY ARMED MEN
WEARING CIVILIAN CLOTHES.  THE MNR ALSO DEMANDED THAT THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT GUARANTEE THE SECURITY OF MNR SECRETARY GENERAL GUILLERMO UNGO,
WHO WILL ARRIVE IN EL SALVADOR WITHIN THE NEXT FEW HOURS TO ATTEND OQUELI'S
FUNERAL, WHICH IS SCHEDULED FOR 15 JANUARY.

   OQUELI, 45, AND GILDA FLORES, A MEMBER OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST PARTY
(PSD) OF GUATEMALA, WERE KIDNAPPED WHILE THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY TO LA AURORA
AIRPORT IN GUATEMALA CITY.  THEIR BODIES WERE FOUND LATER AT A PLACE NEAR
THE SALVADORAN BORDER.

   "THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS UNJUSTIFIABLE ASSASSINATION ARE THE
ETERNAL ENEMIES OF LIBERTY, PEACE, AND DEMOCRACY," THE MNR STATES.  THE MNR,
ALONG WITH THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THE SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PEOPLE'S
MOVEMENT [MPSC], MAKE UP THE DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE COALITION.

   THE MPSC ALSO ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE DEPLORING THE ASSASSINATION OF OQUELI
AND URGING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO CONDEMN THIS ACTION.

DEV-MUC3-0045  (NOSC)

   TEGUCIGALPA, 26 JAN 89 -- [INTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT JOSE AZCONA BY JULIO
ARMANDO VALDES] [EXCERPT] [AZCONA] ...WHICH HAS DISMAYED ALL HONDURAN
PEOPLE.  THE GOVERNMENT STRONGLY CONDEMNS THIS KIND OF ACTION--THE MURDER
OF [RETIRED] GENERAL GUSTAVO ALVAREZ MARTINEZ--WHICH WAS POLITICALLY
MOTIVATED AND PERPETRATED BY PROFESSIONALS, AND WHICH, I BELIEVE, DESERVES
THE DENUNCIATION OF ALL HONDURANS.

   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, WILL THE THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT AND THE
ARMED FORCES ADOPT ADDITIONAL SECURITY MEASURES?

   [AZCONA] YES, WE WILL BE DISCUSSING THAT SOON.  I HAVE A MEETING
SCHEDULED WITH THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, WHICH WILL ALSO BE
ATTENDED BY THE THREE PRESIDENTS OF THE STATE BRANCHES.  I MEAN, THE
[WORDS INDISTINCT] WILL CHAIR THE MEETING, AND NATIONAL CONGRESS
PRESIDENT CARLOS ARBIN MONTOYA AND SUPREME COURT PRESIDENT SALOMON
JIMENEZ CASTRO WILL ALSO ATTEND.  WE HAVE ALSO INVITED THE CANDIDATES
OF THE TWO [NUMBER AS HEARD] PARTIES TO THIS MEETING SINCE ONE OF THEM
IS GOING TO BE THE NEXT HONDURAN PRESIDENT.  WE PLAN TO ESTABLISH SOME
GUIDELINE--SOME RULES TO BE FOLLOWED--NOT JUST FOR THE REMAINDER OF
OUR TERM BUT IN THE FUTURE AS WELL, BECAUSE WE SHOULD BE FARSIGHTED
AND NOT JUST CONCENTRATE ON THE SHORT TERM, WHICH HAS BEEN VERY COMMON
IN HONDURAS, WHERE WE LOOK AND FIND SOLUTIONS ONLY FOR THE PRESENT.
WE SHOULD FIND SOLUTIONS JOINTLY [WORDS INDISTINCT] IN THE LONG RUN,
WHICH INCLUDES THE ISSUE OF VIOLENCE.  WE BELIEVE IN A DEMOCRACY LIKE
OURS, WHICH IS A VERY COMPLETE DEMOCRACY.  IN OTHER WORDS, THERE ARE
INTERNAL ELECTIONS FOR SELECTING CANDIDATES, WHERE CITIZENS ENJOY FULL
RIGHTS, WHERE PARTIES AND PARTY LEADERS CONSULT WITH THE PEOPLE, WHERE
WE HAVE TRUE, CLEAN, AND HONEST ELECTIONS, WHERE WE HAVE A NATIONAL
ELECTORAL COMMISSION THAT IS NOT INFLUENCED BY NOR CAN IT BE
INFLUENCED BY THE GOVERNMENT, AND WHERE THE STATE BRANCHES ARE TOTALLY
INDEPENDENT.

   ALL OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS MAKE HONDURAS A DEMOCRACY, AND EVERY
SECTOR OF HONDURAN SOCIETY SHOULD STRIVE TO STRENGTHEN THEM BY AVOIDING
VIOLENCE AT ALL COSTS, OBEYING THE LAW, AND CONDEMNING AND ATTACKING
EXTREME TERRORIST GROUPS REGARDLESS OF THEIR AFFILIATION, THUS ENABLING US
TO CONSOLIDATE OUR DEMOCRACY AND REACH THE LEVEL OF POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT
ATTAINED BY OTHER DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES.

   IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED WORLDWIDE THAT PROGRESS AND DEVELOPMENT CAN
ONLY BE ACHIEVED THROUGH DEMOCRACY.  THE FRG, THE MEDITERRANEAN
COUNTRIES--ITALY, FRANCE, AND SPAIN--ARE EXAMPLES OF THIS, AND THERE IS
THE CASE OF JAPAN, WHICH HAS A LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM AND HAS ACHIEVED
EXTRAORDINARY LEVELS OF DEVELOPMENT.  TAIWAN IS YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE.  AT
THIS STAGE...

   [VALDES, INTERRUPTING] YES, BUT THIS TAKES TIME.

   [AZCONA] YES.  AT THIS STAGE I BELIEVE THERE IS SUFFICIENT PROOF THAT
THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM IS THE BEST MEANS OF ATTAINING HIGHER LEVELS OF
DEVELOPMENT.  THERE IS NO DOUBT IN ANYONE'S MIND ABOUT THAT, BUT THE FACT
THAT WE HAVE THIS SYSTEM IS NOT ENOUGH.  EACH ONE OF US, EACH SECTOR, MUST
DO HIS PART TO MAKE IT WORK.

   WHEN I MENTION SECTORS, I AM REFERRING TO PRIVATE ENTERPRISE, WHICH
MUST BE GENEROUS, EXHIBIT CONFIDENCE IN THE COUNTRY, AND SHOW MUCH
INITIATIVE; TO ORGANIZED LABOR GROUPS, WHICH MUST FIGHT FOR THEIR RIGHTS
WITHOUT FOMENTING STRIKES AND OTHER DISORDERS, WHICH ARE SOMETIMES BROUGHT
ABOUT ILLEGALLY INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING THE NORMAL LEGAL PROCEDURES; TO
PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, WHICH ALSO HAVE AN ENORMOUS RESPONSIBILITY,
BECAUSE THEIR MEMBERS MUST COMPLY WITH THEIR DUTIES; AND THE SAME GOES FOR
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES AND OTHERS.

   IN OTHER WORDS, THIS WILL NOT BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THIS OR THE NEXT
GOVERNMENT ALONE.  OUR GOVERNMENTS ARE TRANSITORY AND THEIR POWER IS
RELATIVE.  I HAVE SAID THIS MANY TIMES.  THERE IS NO POINT IN LASHING OUT
AT THE PRESIDENT, BECAUSE POWER IN HONDURAS IS RELATIVE AND CONDITIONAL.
WHAT IS ESSENTIAL IS TO CONTRIBUTE POSITIVELY TOWARD HONDURAS'
DEVELOPMENT.  THIS SHOULD BE A RESPONSIBILITY NOT ONLY OF PUBLIC
EMPLOYEES, BUSINESSMEN, WORKERS, AND ORGANIZED PEASANTS, BUT ALL HONDURANS
SHOULD CONTRIBUTE.  THAT IS WHAT COUNTS.

   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, WHEN WILL THIS MEETING BE HELD AND WHAT IMMEDIATE
MEASURES WILL YOU PROPOSE?

   [AZCONA] THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES ARE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO
INVESTIGATE THE LATEST CRIME, WHICH WAS NOT AN EVERYDAY OCCURRENCE LIKE A
ROBBERY OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE.  THIS CRIME WAS CAREFULLY PLANNED.  IT
WAS A TERRORIST ACT PERPETRATED BY PROFESSIONALS.

   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT THE DEATH
PENALTY MIGHT BE A WAY TO COPE WITH THE SITUATION.  WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THIS?

   [AZCONA] I RECENTLY READ SOMETHING ABOUT THE DEATH PENALTY IN A MEXICAN
MAGAZINE.  THE DEATH PENALTY IS OPPOSED BY A MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE AND HAS
BEEN ABOLISHED IN HONDURAS.  I DO NOT THINK THIS IS THE SOLUTION HERE
BECAUSE THE DEATH PENALTY HAS NOT SOLVED THE CRIME PROBLEM ANYWHERE ELSE IN
THE WORLD.  FOR INSTANCE, THIS PENALTY EXISTS IN MANY U.S. STATES, BUT THIS
HAS NOT DETERRED CRIMINALS FROM COMMITTING TERRIBLE CRIMES.  PEOPLE HAVE
LOST CONTROL.  WHEN CRIMINALS HAVE NO RESPECT FOR THEIR FELLOW MAN, NOT
EVEN THE DEATH PENALTY CAN STOP THEM.  HOWEVER, THERE ARE CRIMES, SUCH AS
DRUG TRAFFICKING, FOR WHICH NO BAIL SHOULD BE PERMITTED.  I THINK A BILL
THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED BY THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE SHOULD BE PASSED BY
THE CONGRESS.  OF COURSE, IT WILL BE APPROVED BY THE PRESIDENT SO THOSE
FOUND GUILTY OF THIS CRIME CANNOT BE BAILED OUT.  IT IS NOT RIGHT FOR THE
AUTHORITIES TO ARREST A DRUG TRAFFICKER ONLY TO SEE HIM RELEASED ON BAIL
BY A JUDGE WHO HAS NO OTHER CHOICE THAN TO ABIDE BY THE LAW.

   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, THE FAR RIGHTIST GROUP AAA [ANTICOMMUNIST ACTION
ALLIANCE], THROUGH A LOCAL RADIO STATION, WARNED THAT THEY WILL TAKE
REVENGE ON MAJOR COMMUNIST LEADERS, SUCH AS JORGE ARTURO REINA, RAMON
CUSTODIO, AND OTHERS.  WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS?

   [AZCONA] I AM ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO THIS TYPE OF REVENGE BECAUSE IT WOULD
ONLY LEAD TO ESCALATED CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN GROUPS.  I CONDEMN THIS
ATTITUDE IN VIEW OF THE REGRETTABLE MURDER OF GENERAL GUSTAVO ALVAREZ
MARTINEZ.  AS FAR AS THE DEATH PENALTY GOES, IT WILL NOT BE A SOLUTION TO
THE CRIME PROBLEM.

   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, CIVIC COMMITTEES HAVE TO BE ORGANIZED IN THE
COUNTRY.

   [AZCONA] I AGREE, BUT THESE COMMITTEES SHOULD BE CONTROLLED BY THE
AUTHORITIES.  A CIVIC COMMITTEE TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES IS ONE THING, BUT IT
IS QUITE ANOTHER THING TO SUE THESE COMMITTEES TO PERFORM DUTIES THAT ARE
ALREADY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF STATE AGENCIES, SUCH AS THE ARMED FORCES.

   [VALDES] WHEN WILL THE GOVERNMENT BRANCHES MEET?

   [AZCONA] THEY WILL MEET WHEN I RETURN FROM CARACAS.

DEV-MUC3-0062 (NOSC)

   SAN SALVADOR, 6 FEB 89 -- [TEXT] JUSTICE MINISTER JULIO ALFREDO SAMAYOA
SAID TODAY ALL THE EVIDENCE GATHERED BY THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS
COMMISSION DEMONSTRATES THAT DR ANTONIO REGALADO WAS THE PERPETRATOR OF
THE MURDER OF MSGR ROMERO.

   IN HIS CAPACITY AS CHAIRMAN OF THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS COMMISSION,
DR JULIO ALFREDO SAMAYOA REPORTED TODAY IN DETAIL ON THE MURDER OF MSGR
OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO.  DR SAMAYOA SAID TO CLARIFY THE CASE, THE COMMISSION
HAS CONDUCTED 238 MEETINGS, OVER 100 INQUIRIES, AND 21 DEPOSITIONS.  HE
ADDED THAT THE INVESTIGATION WAS CARRIED OUT UNDER THE NAME OF "OPERATION
PINEAPPLE" AND THAT IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON WAS THE
MASTERMIND AND DR ANTONIO REGALADO WAS THE PERPETRATOR.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [SAMAYOA] THERE IS NO DOUBT.  ALL THE INVESTIGATIONS
CARRIED OUT BY THE COMMISSION POINT TO MAJ ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON AS THE
MASTERMIND.  THIS HAS TO BE PROVEN IN COURT.  HOWEVER, HE HAS PARLIAMENTARY
IMMUNITY; HE CANNOT BE BROUGHT TO COURT.  THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN
ALLIANCE [ARENA] HAS THE MAJORITY IN THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, AND ARENA IS
NOT GOING TO PERMIT A DECLARATION THAT WILL BRING HIS CASE TO COURT. [END
RECORDING]

   DR SAMAYOA ALSO SAID HE IS WILLING TO PRESENT ALL THE EVIDENCE HE HAS
ON THE CASE.  HOWEVER, HE SAID HE DID NOT TRUST THE BEHAVIOR OF THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE REPUBLIC:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [SAMAYOA] WE WILL PRESENT THE EVIDENCE.  I THINK THEY
ARE GOING TO BE SORRY THEY MADE THAT REQUEST, BECAUSE MANY PERSONS ARE
INVOLVED.  SINCE THEIR PARTICIPATION HAS NOT YET BEEN PROVEN, THESE NAMES
HAVE NOT YET BEEN RELEASED.  HOWEVER, WHEN WE PRESENT THE ENTIRE DOSSIER TO
THE COURTS, THESE NAMES ARE GOING TO COME UP.  THEN SOME WILL JUDGE AND
DECIDE IF THEY PARTICIPATED OR NOT.  BUT THEIR NAMES ARE THERE, AS ARE
THEIR ACTIVITIES AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS TO THE DEATH SQUADS.  MANY
PERSONS WHO ARE MENTIONED ARE APPARENTLY RESPECTABLE, AND I MEAN
RESPECTABLE IN QUOTES.  [END RECORDING]

   THE ASSASSINATION OF MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO TOOK PLACE ON 24 MARCH
1980; ACCORDING TO THE OFFICIAL, THE INVESTIGATIONS HAVE TAKEN 9 YEARS
BECAUSE MANY PERSONS CONSIDERED KEY WITNESSES HAVE DIED SINCE THE TIME OF
THE MURDER.  HOWEVER, HE ADDED, WITH THE COOPERATION OF THE FBI AS WELL AS
SOME CENTRAL AMERICAN INVESTIGATION ORGANIZATIONS, THE CASE HAS BEEN
CLARIFIED, WHICH MIGHT LEAD TO THE IMPRISONMENT OF MAJ D'AUBUISSON ONCE HE
LOSES HIS PARLIAMENTARY IMMUNITY.

DEV-MUC3-0075 (NOSC)

   TEGUCIGALPA, 7 FEB (REUTER) -- [TEXT] A BOMB BLAST DAMAGED A TELEPHONE
OFFICE TODAY IN THE NORTHERN CITY OF SAN PEDRO SULA.  A LEFTIST GROUP,
WHICH CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR AN ATTACK ON A U.S. MILITARY CONVOY LAST
WEEK CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS ATTACK.

   THE BOMB, MADE UP OF DYNAMITE AND A FUSE, EXPLODED JUST BEFORE DAWN IN
THE HONDUTEL [HONDURAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS ENTERPRISE] OFFICE IN SAN PEDRO
SULA, 190 KM NORTH OF THIS CAPITAL.

   THE EXPLOSION DAMAGED FURNITURE, FOUR TELEPHONES, AND SHATTERED
WINDOWS, BUT NOBODY WAS INJURED.

   LEAFLETS FOUND IN THE RUBBLE STATED THAT A LEFTIST GROUP WAS RESPONSIBLE
BOTH FOR THE BOMB AS WELL AS THE ATTACK ON A U.S. MILITARY CONVOY LAST WEEK
IN THE HONDURAN NORTHERN MOUNTAIN REGION.

   ALTHOUGH NO CASUALTIES WERE REPORTED, ONE OF THE VEHICLES IN THE U.S.
CONVOY WAS HIT BY TWO BULLETS.  UNTIL TODAY NOBODY HAD CLAIMED CREDIT FOR
THAT ATTACK.

   "THE JACOBO CARCOMO COMMAND OF THE MORAZANIST PATRIOTIC FRONT [FPM]
ATTACKED A U.S. CONVOY WITH M-16 RIFLE-FIRE," THE LEAFLETS READ.  CARCOMO
WAS A HONDURAN LEFT-WING AUTHOR AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 20TH CENTURY.

   THE FPM, NAMED AFTER A CENTRAL AMERICAN LEADER OF THE LAST CENTURY, HAS
CLAIMED CREDIT FOR SEVERAL GUERRILLA ATTACKS IN THE PAST.

   HONDURAS HAS BEEN GRIPPED BY A WAVE OF VIOLENCE THIS YEAR, INCLUDING THE
ASSASSINATIONS OF A FORMER ARMED FORCES COMMANDER, A COMMANDER OF THE
ANTI-SANDINIST REBELS (SUPPORTED BY THE UNITED STATES), AND A LAWYER OF AN
ALLEGED DRUG TRAFFICKING TSAR.

   PRESIDENT JOSE AZCONA HAS CALLED FOR NATIONAL DIALOGUE STARTING THIS
WEEK WITH THE GOVERNMENT, THE OPPOSITION PARTIES, LABOR UNIONS,
BUSINESSMEN, AND OTHER GROUPS TO TRY TO CURB THE SUDDEN SURGE OF VIOLENCE.

   HONDURAS, A CLOSE U.S. ALLY, HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN A PEACEFUL COUNTRY
IN A REGION STRICKEN BY INTERNAL CONFLICTS.

FORCES OF COLOMBIA (FARC) FRONTS IN ANTIOQUIA, META, AND HUILA DEPARTMENTS.
ONE ARMY LIEUTENANT, FOUR SOLDIERS, AND THREE CIVILIANS WERE KILLED DURING
THE ATTACKS.

   THE DEFENSE MINISTRY REPORTED THE FIRST INCIDENT TOOK PLACE AT LA
LINEA, A CORREGIMIENTO LOCATED IN ALGECIRAS MUNICIPALITY, HUILA
DEPARTMENT, WHERE A FARC FRONT AMBUSHED AN 11TH BRIGADE ARMY PATROL.
SEVERAL MINES PLACED IN THE AREA WENT OFF WHEN THE SOLDIERS PASSED THROUGH
LA LINEA CORREGIMIENTO.  LIEUTENANT JAIME QUINTERO CARDONA AND SOLDIERS
NELSON SANCHEZ MOLINA, MAXIMILIANO SERRATO CUELLAR, AND DAIRO SUAREZ
SUAREZ WERE KILLED IN THIS ACTION.

   IN ADDITION, THE FERVOR OF THE SATURDAY PROCESSION AND PRAYERS WERE
INTERRUPTED IN SANTA RITA CORREGIMIENTO, ITUANGO MUNICIPALITY, ANTIOQUIA
DEPARTMENT, AT 1800 BY 200 GUERRILLAS WHO ENTERED THE TOWN SHOOTING AT ARMY
TROOPS--APPROXIMATELY 72 SOLDIERS--WHO WERE RETURNING TO THE TOWN AFTER
THEIR PATROL OPERATIONS.

   GIRARDO BATTALION OFFICERS, WHO ASKED US NOT TO REVEAL THEIR NAMES,
STATED THAT THE REBELS, WHO WERE MEMBERS OF THE FARC 28TH FRONT, ATTACKED
TWO TRUCKS FILLED WITH SOLDIERS.

   THE SANTA RITA POLICE CHIEF FOUND THE BODIES OF A SOLDIER AND A REBEL
ON THE ROAD LEADING TO SANTA RITA.  THE SOLDIER WAS IDENTIFIED AS EDISON
ESTRADA BOLIVAR.  SOLDIER RAUL DURANGO HERRERA WAS WOUNDED AND TAKEN TO
THE PABLO TOBON URIBE HOSPITAL IN MEDELLIN.

   THE DEAD REBEL, WHO HAS NOT YET BEEN IDENTIFIED, HAD A SUBMACHINEGUN, 3
CLIPS, AND 30 9-MM CARTRIDGES ON HIM.

   ITUANGO MUNICIPALITY, 195 KM NORTH OF MEDELLIN, IS NEAR LOWER CAUCA,
WHERE THE ARMY DISMANTLED DURING HOLY WEEK A FARC 37TH FRONT PLAN DESIGNED
TO COMMIT AND CARRY OUT AMBUSHES AND ASSAULTS.

   MEANWHILE, AT LEAST 50 FARC REBELS BLEW UP A JEEP NEAR SAN JUAN DE URAMA
MUNICIPALITY NEAR ROAD NO 32 IN META DEPARTMENT.

   ACCORDING TO POLICE COMMANDER COLONEL JOSE WILLIAM BERMUDEZ ZAPATA, WHO
COMMANDS ANTIGUERRILLA OPERATIONS WITH THE SUPPORT OF 7TH BRIGADE TROOPS,
THE REBELS KILLED THREE PEOPLE AND TOOK THE FOURTH PASSENGER OF THE JEEP
WITH THEM.

   THE VICTIMS--WHO WERE INVOLVED IN COCAINE TRAFFICKING--ARE:  ALFONSO
OLIVARES, ALIAS PICO FRESCO; AN N.N. [NOT FURTHER IDENTIFIED] KNOWN AS EL
MOCHO; AND ROMAN OLIVARES GUTIERREZ.  JAIME MONTEALEGRE IS THE NAME OF THE
PERSON TAKEN BY THE REBELS.

   MEANWHILE, WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESULTS
OF THE OPERATIONS CONDUCTED BY 5TH BRIGADE TROOPS COMMANDED BY GENERAL
ALFONSO VACA PERILLA IN THE AREAS OF EL CARMEN AND SAN VICENTE DE CHUCURRI,
SANTANDER DEPARTMENT.

   COL JORGE ERNESTO FERRERO ECHEVERRI, SANTANDER DEPARTMENT POLICE
COMMANDER, SAID THE SPECIAL SECURITY COUNCIL WILL MEET TODAY (MONDAY) TO
ASSESS THE SITUATION.

   COL FERRERO EXPLAINED THAT "IN PRINCIPLE, WE HAVE REPORTS SAYING MANY
PEOPLE WERE KILLED, BUT WE DO NOT KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY.  WE KNOW SEVEN
PEASANTS WERE MURDERED BY FARC 12TH FRONT MEMBERS."

   HELICOPTERS CONTINUE OVERFLYING THE BATTLE ZONE.  AIRBORNE TROOPS
REPLACED THE TROOPS WHO WERE FIGHTING AGAINST THE MEN UP IN ARMS.

   PEASANTS WHO ARRIVED AT SAN VICENTE CHUCURRI SAID POWERFUL EXPLOSIONS
HAVE BEEN CONTINUOUSLY HEARD SINCE THE MILITARY ACTIONS BEGAN ON 22 MARCH.

   ARMY OFFICERS BELIEVE THE REBEL COLUMN IS SURROUNDED IN A MOUNTAINOUS
STRIP LOCATED BETWEEN EL CARMEN AND SAN VICENTE CHUCURRI MUNICIPALITIES.

   GEN VACA PERILLA RETURNED TO THE AREA YESTERDAY, BUT HE DID NOT MAKE ANY
STATEMENTS.  HE HAS BEEN COMMANDING OPERATIONS IN THE AREA FOR THE LAST 5
DAYS.

   AN UNOFFICIAL REPORT INDICATED TWO HELICOPTERS WERE HIT BY FARC REBELS'

DEV-MUC3-0106 (BELLCORE)

   SAN SALVADOR, 3 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] LEADERS OF THE MAIN OPPOSITION
LABOR UNIONS IN EL SALVADOR TODAY VOICED SUPPORT FOR THE GUERRILLAS'
DECISION TO SUSPEND DIALOGUE WITH THE GOVERNMENT UNTIL IT COMMITS ITSELF TO
GUARANTEEING THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF THE MEMBERS OF THE PEOPLE'S ORGANIZATIONS.

   THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS DECIDED TO SUSPEND THE DIALOGUE PROCESS WITH
THE GOVERNMENT FOLLOWING THE 31 OCTOBER DYNAMITE ATTACK THAT LEFT 10 DEAD
AND 30 WOUNDED, AND ALSO DEMANDED THAT THE UNITED NATIONS, THE OAS, AND THE
CATHOLIC CHURCH PROVIDE "GUARANTEES FOR THE OPPOSITION ORGANIZATIONS."

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) DECISION COINCIDED
WITH THE BURIAL OF THE 10 UNION LEADERS KILLED IN THE BOMB EXPLOSION AT THE
HEADQUARTERS OF THE OPPOSITION SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION
(FENASTRAS).

   IN A COMMUNIQUE THE FMLN INSISTED THAT THE DYNAMITE ATTACK AGAINST
FENASTRAS "WAS PLANNED BY COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, APPROVED BY THE
PRESIDENT (ALFREDO CRISTIANI), AND CARRIED OUT BY COLONEL ELENA FUENTES."

   IN THE COMMUNIQUE SIGNED BY ITS TOP FIVE COMMANDERS, THE FMLN ADDED
THAT "WE MUST PREVENT OUR PRESENCE IN THE DIALOGUE FROM BEING USED TO
COVER UP THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS SLAUGHTER."

   HUMBERTO CENTENO, LEADER OF THE NATIONAL UNION OF SALVADORAN WORKERS
(UNTS), WHICH CLAIMS TO HAVE A MEMBERSHIP OF 200,000 PERSONS, SAID THAT
"THIS IS A LOGICAL AND CORRECT DECISION BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT HAS
DECLARED WAR ON THE WORKERS AND NOT ON THE FMLN."

   ORLANDO AREVALO, LEADER OF THE NATIONAL PEASANT WORKERS UNITY--OF A
CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC TREND--WONDERED IF IT WAS WORTH IT FOR THE MARXIST
GUERRILLAS TO HOLD A DIALOGUE WITH THE RIGHTIST GOVERNMENT WHILE "THE
PEOPLE ARE BEING MURDERED."

   POLITICAL LEADERS OF SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC AND CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC LEANINGS
VOICED THEIR CONCERN OVER THE SUSPENSION OF THE PEACE TALKS AND COMMITTED
THEMSELVES TO CONTACTING THE FMLN LEADERS TO MAKE THEM RECONSIDER NOT
ATTENDING THE THIRD ROUND OF THE DIALOGUE THAT WAS SLATED FOR 20 AND 21
NOVEMBER IN CARACAS (VENEZUELA).

   EDGAR PALACIOS, COORDINATOR OF THE PERMANENT COMMITTEE FOR THE NATIONAL
DIALOGUE (CPDN), REGRETTED THE FMLN'S DECISION AND WARNED THAT "WHEN THE
DOORS TO DIALOGUE ARE CLOSED, THE DOORS TO WAR ARE OPENED."

   SEVERAL OPPOSITION LEADERS POINTED OUT THAT THE SUSPENSION OF THE TALKS
WILL WORSEN THE WAR AND WILL BRING MORE BLOODSHED, BUT HIS OPINION WAS NOT
SHARED BY THE WORKERS, WHO STATED THEY ARE "VICTIMS OF AN OPEN WAR BY THE
GOVERNMENT."

   CENTENO ADDED:  "WHAT MORE WILL HAPPEN?  THE ONLY THING MISSING IS FOR
THE TANKS TO ROLL DOWN THE STREETS AGAINST US.  WE HAVE BEEN ATTACKED, AND
WE--THE WORKERS--HAVE NOT MURDERED ANYONE.  WE HAVE PARTICIPATED IN
POLITICAL DEBATES AND DEMAND THAT THE GOVERNMENT MEET OUR BASIC NEEDS."

   THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN BEGAN A DIALOGUE IN SEPTEMBER IN MEXICO.
IN THE FIRST MEETING, THEY AGREED TO MEET IN COSTA RICA IN OCTOBER TO
DRAFT A CEASE-FIRE THAT WILL END AN INTERNAL WAR THAT HAS LEFT OVER 70,000
DEAD IN 9 YEARS.

DEV-MUC3-0123 (BELLCORE)

   SANTIAGO, 14 MAR 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] AGRICULTURE
MINISTER JAIME DE LA SOTTA AND FOREIGN MINISTER HERNAN FELIPE
ERRAZURIZ WILL LEAVE TONIGHT FOR THE UNITED STATES IN AN ATTEMPT TO
ACHIEVE THE LIFTING OF THE BAN ON IMPORTED CHILEAN FRUITS.  THEY WILL
TAKE LAN-CHILE FLIGHT 141 THAT DEPARTS AT APPROXIMATELY 2100 FROM
SANTIAGO AND GOES DIRECTLY TO NEW YORK.

   IN NEW YORK, THE TWO MINISTERS WILL TAKE ANOTHER PLANE TO WASHINGTON AND
WILL ARRIVE AT APPROXIMATELY NOON TOMORROW. IN THE U.S. CAPITAL THEY WILL
MEET WITH OFFICIALS OF THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION.

   THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE TRIP IS TO ACHIEVE THE LIFTING OF THE BAN ON
IMPORTED CHILEAN FRUITS.  U.S. OFFICIALS ANNOUNCED THE BAN OVER AN UNUSUAL
TELEVISION NETWORK FOLLOWING THE DISCOVERY THAT SOME CHILEAN GRAPES WERE
LACED CYANIDE.  DE LA SOTTA STATED THAT THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE DAMAGE
THAT TERRORISM CAN CAUSE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [DE LA SOTTA] YOU CAN SEE AND MEASURE THE SCOPE OF A
TERRORIST ACT SUCH AS THE ONE WE HAVE JUST EXPERIENCED, THE SOLE OBJECTIVE
OF WHICH IS TO CAUSE HARM. THIS CAN BE DEMONSTRATED BY THE ADVERTISEMENT,
NOT A CLEAR AND CONCRETE ADVERTISEMENT, BUT AN ANONYMOUS TELEPHONE CALL BY
WHICH THEY WARNED US, THAT IS, THEY WARNED THE EMBASSIES THEY CALLED, THAT
THEY WOULD CARRY OUT SUCH AN ACT.  THIS CALL WAS MADE 3 DAYS AFTER THE
DEPARTURE OF THE FRUIT SHIPMENT.  WE ATTEMPTED TO CONTROL THE SITUATION TO
THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, FOLLOWING TECHNICAL PROCEDURES CONCERNING THE AMOUNT OF
SAMPLES TAKEN.  THEN WE ANNOUNCED THAT THE SITUATION WAS UNDER CONTROL, THAT
IT WAS AN ANOMYOUS CALL AND AS SUCH COULD NOT BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.  LATER, IN
THE SHIPMENTS THAT ARRIVED IN THE UNITED STATES LAST WEEKEND, THE PRESENCE
OF CYANIDE WAS DETECTED IN TWO GRAPES.  [END RECORDING]

   DE LA SOTTA ADDED THAT ALL POSSIBLE EFFORTS WILL BE MADE TO OVERCOME THE
IMPASSE.  THE MAJOR PROBLEM NOW INVOLVES THE 17 MILLION BOXES THAT ARRIVED
AT THEIR PORTS OF DESTINATION READY FOR DISTRIBUTION.  NOW NO ONE KNOWS WHAT
TO DO WITH THEM.  THERE ARE 7 OR 8 MILLION BOXES MORE BEING SHIPPED TO THE
SAME PORTS, AND 3 MILLION BOXES REMAIN IN THE COUNTRY, READY TO BE SHIPPED.
DE LA SOTTA SAID THAT THE CYANIDE WAS FOUND IN TWO SINGLE GRAPES.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [DE LA SOTTA] THE ESSENTIAL THING, I BELIEVE, IS [WORDS
INDISTINCT] THAT THE UNITED STATES CAN ADOPT MEASURES.  WE WILL TALK WITH
THE HEALTH OFFICIALS TO GIVE THEM THE NECESSARY ASSURANCES SO THEY CAN LIFT
THE BAN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  [END RECORDING]

   IN ORDER TO FACE THE PROBLEM, THE GOVERNMENT HAS CREATED THREE COMISSIONS
TO STUDY THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE PROBLEM, THE AGRICULTURE MINISTER
STATED.

DEV-MUC3-0176 (ADS)

   LIMA, 17 APR 89 (TELAM-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE POLICE HAVE ARRESTED JOSE
LUIS FRANCISCO GUTIERREZ, A COLOMBIAN CITIZEN, 28, WHO IS SUSPECTED OF
BEING A MEMBER OF THE COLOMBIAN M-19 GUERRILLA GROUP.

   GUTIERREZ WAS ARRESTED YESTERDAY WHILE TRAVELLING IN A CAR WITH PERUVIAN
ENGINEER MIGUEL RINCON RINCON IN WHOSE POSSESSION THE POLICE FOUND
SUBVERSIVE PROPAGANDA FROM THE OUTLAWED REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT TUPAC AMARU
(MRTA) OF PERU.  

   POLICE INTELLIGENCE SOURCES AFFIRMED HAVE CONFIRMED THE ARREST OF THIS
COLOMBIAN CITIZEN AND SAID THAT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE HE MAY BE THE
LIASON BETWEEN THE M-19 AND THE MRTA.  TWO YEARS AGO, THESE GROUPS CREATED
THE NOW DISMANTLED "AMERICA BATTALLION," WHICH STATED SOME ARMED OPERATION
IN COLOMBIAN TERRITORY.  

   THE ARREST OF JOSE LUIS FRANCISCO GUTIERREZ BRINGS TO THREE THE NUMBER OF
COLOMBIANS THAT HAVE BEEN SEIZED AND THAT ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE
ANTITERRORIST POLICE (DIRCOTE).  HENRY VLADIMIR DELGADO SALAZAR AND JOSE
ALZATE CARDONA WERE ARRESTED FOLLOWING THE ARMED ATTACK ON THE POLICE POST
AT UCHIZA, IN THE PERUVIAN NORTHEAST, WHERE 10 POLICEMEN WERE KILLED.

   SAN SALVADOR, 3 MAY 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS
TODAY DENIED HAVING CARRIED OUT A DYNAMITE ATTACK AGAINST A U.S. EMBASSY
WAREHOUSE IN SAN SALVADOR, AN ATTACK OFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE BLAMED ON THE
GUERRILLAS.  THERE WERE NO INJURIES IN TUESDAY NIGHT'S ATTACK.

   OFFICIAL SOURCES REPORT TODAY THAT URBAN GUERRILLAS THREW TWO EXPLOSIVE
DEVICES FROM A VEHICLE AT THE SAN JORGE WAREHOUSE, A U.S.  EMBASSY FACILITY
IN THE SAN ANTONIO ABAD NEIGHBORHOOD IN NORTHWESTERN SAN SALVADOR.  

   A FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) SPOKESMAN CLAIMED THAT
THE ATTACK WAS "A CRUDE MANEUVER BY THE SALVADORAN ARMY AND THE NATIONALIST
REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA), WHICH WILL BE GOVERNING EL SALVADOR AS OF 1
JUNE, TO COMPLICATE THE GUERRILLA DELEGATION'S U.S. VISIT."  THE REBEL
SOURCE CONFIRMED AN FMLN DECISION FIRST ANNOUNCED 3 MONTHS AGO THAT NO U.S.
DIPLOMATIC OR ECONOMIC FACILITY IN EL SALVADOR WILL BE CONSIDERED A MILITARY
TARGET.

   AN FMLN DELEGATION WILL MEET TODAY IN NEW YORK WITH UN ASSISTANT
SECRETARY ALVARO DE SOTO AND PERMANENT UN REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE FRG,
CANADA, AND SPAIN.  MEMBERS OF THE POLITICAL DIPLOMATIC GUERRILLA
DELEGATION, WHICH OBTAINED UNRESTRICTED VISAS, WILL ASK THE UNITED NATIONS
TO PARTICIPATE MORE ACTIVELY IN THE SEARCH FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE
SALVADORAN ARMED CONFLICT.  THE GUERRILLAS WILL ALSO ASK THE UNITED NATIONS
TO REMAIN ALERT TO THE SITUATION AND TO EXERT PRESSURE ON THE FUTURE ARENA
ADMINISTRATION -- TO BE HEADED BY RIGHTIST ALFREDO CRISTIANI -- TO ENSURE
THAT IT RESPECTS HUMAN RIGHTS.

   LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY PRESIDENT RICARDO ALVARENGA VALDIVIESO, AN ARENA
MEMBER, DESCRIBED THE REBEL DELEGATION'S U.S. VISIT AS "DANGEROUS AND
RIDICULOUS."  "I REALLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THE UNITED STATES COULD GRANT
VISAS TO TERRORISTS," ALVARENGA SAID IN REFERENCE TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S
DENIAL OF A VISA TO EXTREME RIGHT-WING DEPUTY ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON, WHO HAS
BEEN LINKED TO THE DEATH SQUADS.

   THE DELEGATION, WHOSE U.S. VISIT WILL LAST MORE THAN 8 DAYS, IS HEADED BY
SALVADOR SAMAYOA, MIGUEL SAENZ, AND COMMANDER MERCEDES DEL CARMEN LETONA,
ALSO KNOWN AS "LUISA."

   U.S. EMBASSY OFFICIALS HAD DESTROYED THE CAMERAS OF THE LOCAL NEWSCAST
"UP TO DATE," WHOSE REPORTERS ATTEMPTED TO PHOTOGRAPH THE SCENE OF THE
ATTACK.

DEV-MUC3-0201 (ADS)

   LIMA, 8 MAY 89 (TELEVISION PERUANA) -- [EXCERPTS] SENATOR LUIS
ALBERTO SANCHEZ HAS BEEN DESIGNATED NEW PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF
MINISTERS.  THIS WAS REPORTED BY PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA ON ARRIVING AT
GOVERNMENT PALACE AFTER PAYING HOMAGE IN CONGRESS TO LATE [APRA
AMERICAN POPULAR REVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE] DEPUTY PABLO LI ORMENO.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ALAN GARCIA] I THINK IT IS A BARBAROUS CRIME WHICH WE
MUST REPUDIATE AND AGAINST WHICH WE MUST ALL FIGHT.

   WE NEED TO PUT ALL POLICE FORCES IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST TERRORISM.  WE
CAN NO LONGER SCATTER OUR EFFORTS AND KEEP SOME SECTORS IDLE.  I HAVE SEEN
POLICE AGENTS WORKING AS DRIVERS, SOME OF THEM PLAYING THE ROLE OF GREAT
PERSONALITIES, OF CHIEFS. I HAVE SEEN MANY POLICEMEN DOING ADMINISTRATIVE
WORK.  WE ARE PAYING THOSE PEOPLE AND WE HAVE TRAINED THEM TO FIGHT AGAINST
OUR MAIN ENEMY, WHICH IS TERRORISM.

   I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS, AND
WITH HIM ALL MEMBERS OF THE MINISTERIAL CABINET, HAVE PRESENTED THEIR
RESIGNATIONS.  PRIME MINISTER ARMANDO VILLANUEVA FEELS THAT A POLITICAL
RENEWAL IS NECESSARY TO GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO THE DEMOCRATIC SECTORS TO
PARTICIPATE MORE ACTIVELY IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST SUBVERSION.  THE MURDER OF
ANOTHER CONGRESSMAN HAS LED THE MINISTERS TO PRESENT THEIR RESIGNATIONS.

   THIS POLITICAL RENEWAL MUST LEAD ALL PERUVIANS TO JOIN EFFORTS.  WE MUST
FORGET OUR ELECTORAL CONFRONTATIONS AND ADVERSITIES FOR A WHILE AND
UNDERSTAND THAT THE STRUGGLE AGAINST TERRORISM IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE
ELECTIONS.  WE MUST UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE AT WAR AGAINST TERRORISM, THAT WE
ARE AT WAR AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, AND THAT THIS WAR REPRESENTS A COST OF
THOUSANDS OF MILLIONS OF INTIS, DOZENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.  WE MUST MAKE
THIS TREMENDOUS EFFORT TO END SUBVERSION ONCE AND FOR ALL. [END RECORDING]

   SAN SALVADOR, 10 MAY 89 (RADIO CADENA SONORA) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
COLONEL MAURICIO ERNESTO VARGAS, COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE 3D INFANTRY
BRIGADE IN SAN MIGUEL, BY STATION CORRESPONDENT SORTO] [TEXT]
CONCERNING A LAST-MINUTE REPORT WHICH INTERNATIONAL NEWS AGENCIES ARE
ATTRIBUTING TO A CLANDESTINE RADIO VENCEREMOS ANNOUNCEMENT OF AN
OPERATION CONCERNING ATTACKS AGAINST SEVERAL MILITARY GARRISONS IN
VARIOUS PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, WE INTERVIEWED COLONEL MAURICIO ERNESTO
VARGAS, COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE STATIONED IN SAN
MIGUEL.  WE CONTACTED HIM BY TELEPHONE, AS FOLLOWS:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [SORTO] COLONEL, IS IT TRUE THIS IS PART OF A REGIONAL
OR NATIONAL OPERATION TO ATTACK THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE?

   [VARGAS] I DO NOT KNOW IF THIS IS PART OF A REGIONAL OR NATIONAL
OPERATION.  ALL I KNOW IS THAT THESE ARE TREACHEROUS, COWARDLY ACTIONS,
BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID OF CONFRONTING THE SOLDIERS, THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE
MILITARY UNITS.  IN SAN MIGUEL, THERE WERE FIVE EXPLOSIONS IN OPEN AREAS
ABOUT 2 TO 3 KM APART.  THERE WERE NO CASUALTIES OR MATERIAL DAMAGE
INFLICTED ON THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE OR ITS INSTALLATIONS.  THEY HIT SOME
FUEL TANKS FILLED WITH ABOUT 3,000 GALLONS OF GASOLINE, WHICH STARTED A
FIRE.  HOWEVER, THE FIRES WERE IN OPEN AREAS, SO THERE HAVE BEEN NO
CASUALTIES OR MATERIAL DAMAGE TO THE INSTALLATIONS.

   [SORTO] THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] CLAIMS IT
SEIZED EL SALITRE ESTATE AND, FROM THERE, ATTACKED THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE.

   [VARGAS] EL SALITRE ESTATE WAS NOT OCCUPIED.  AN OLD SHACK ON THE ESTATE
WAS SET ABLAZE, BUT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT CONTROLLED THE FIRE.  I THINK THESE
ARE THE GREAT REVOLUTIONARY VICTORIES THE FMLN TALKS ABOUT: ATTACKS AGAINST
FIXED INSTALLATIONS THAT CONTAIN NO MILITARY UNITS, WHERE NOT EVEN PEASANTS
ARE SLEEPING AT THE TIME.  I BELIEVE THIS IS WHERE THE FMLN SAYS IT FIGHTS
HEROICALLY FOR 4 HOURS TO BURN SEVEN PATCHES OF CROPS AND HOW IT CLAIMS IT
HEROICALLY FIGHTS TO DOWN POWER TOWERS, WHICH ARE UNMOVING OBJECTS.  THESE
ARE THE ONLY GREAT ACTIONS IT CARRIES OUT, BUT THESE ACTIONS ARE AGAINST
FIXED TARGETS THAT CANNOT MOVE.  I REPEAT, THESE ARE COWARDLY ACTIONS THAT
DO NOT CONFRONT THE SOLDIERS WHO REPRESENT THE MILITARY ABILITIES OF THE
GOVERNMENT AND THE COUNTRY.

   [SORTO] DO YOU HAVE ANY UNITS COMBING THE AREA?  

   [VARGAS] YES, DEFINITELY, WE HAVE MEN IN THE AREA.  THE TRUTH IS THAT
AT 0200 TODAY, UNITS WERE BEING MOBILIZED.  AS I SAID, THESE ARE COWARDLY
ACTIONS, CARRIED OUT IN THE DARK, AND THE FMLN FLEES WHEN IT SEES OUR
WELL-TRAINED MEN IN MILITARY UNIFORM.  THAT IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY.

   [SORTO] YOU HAVE PERMANENT GUARDS FOR SAN MIGUEL.  SOME OF THE MARKET
VENDORS TOLD US FOR THE FIRST TIME, NOT A SINGLE SHOT WAS HEARD.

   [VARGAS] YES, THAT IS RIGHT.  AS I SAID, THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ANY ATTACKS
OR HARASSMENT, JUST FIVE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES, WHICH DOES NOT REPRESENT ANY
CHANGES IN THE CORRELATION OF MILITARY FORCES.  THE PEOPLE OF SAN MIGUEL
SHOULD BE CALM; WE WILL PROVIDE THEM WITH SECURITY.  THE PEOPLE OF THE
EASTERN AREA OF THE COUNTRY SHOULD BE CALM, BECAUSE WE WILL INCREASE OUR
ABILITIES AND EFFORTS TO PROVIDE THEM WITH ALL THE SECURITY POSSIBLE.  THE
FMLN WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR BEING SO AUDACIOUS.

   [SORTO] THE FMLN SAID IT WAS FIGHTING IN BERLIN AND ALEGRIA.  

   [VARGAS] WE HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF ANY ACTION IN BERLIN AND ALEGRIA.  WE
HAVE REPORTS THAT IN SAN ILDEFONSO, SAN VICENTE DEPARTMENT -- SOUTH OF
CABANAS -- THERE WERE PROBLEMS BECAUSE THE NATIONAL GUARD -- WHICH WE
SUPPORT THROUGHOUT THE NATIONAL TERRITORY -- REPORTED SOME CATAPULTS HAD
BEEN FIRED.  HOWEVER, NOTHING ELSE HAPPENED, AND I HAVE NO REPORTS OF ANY
ACTION IN OTHER PLACES.

   [SORTO] TODAY IS MOTHER'S DAY.  

   [VARGAS] YES, DEFINITELY, GREETINGS TO ALL MOTHERS:  HAVE FAITH AND
HOPE THAT YOUR SONS ARE HERE -- FROM THE GENERAL TO THE LAST SOLDIER --
AND THEY LOVE YOU VERY MUCH AND ARE WORKING FOR YOU, SO YOU WILL HAVE THE
PEACE AND TRANQUILITY YOU NEED AS MOTHERS TO GENERATE LOVE AND COURAGE FOR
EACH OF YOUR SONS.  ON BEHALF OF ALL YOUR SONS, THE SOLDIERS, TO ALL
MOTHERS OF THE EASTERN AREA AND OF EL SALVADOR: RECEIVE LOVE AND KISSES.

MISSIONARIES ON NARCOTERRORISTS, WHO WANT TO GIVE IT A POLITICAL
CONNOTATION.  "DRUG TRAFFICKERS MIGHT BE INVOLVED IN THIS CRIME, AND
THEY WANT TO GIVE IT POLITICAL CONNOTATIONS," PEREZ SAID.

   PEREZ SAID THAT THE MRUDER OF THE TWO MISSIONARIES MIGHT BE A "COPYCAT
MURDER" DONE WITH THE INTENTION OF BLAMING THE "ZARATE WILKA GROUP WITH
HAVING DONE IT."  HE ADDED THAT THE GROUP IS NAMED AFTER A PEASANT LEADER
WHO LIVED EARLY THIS CENTURY.  THE PEASANT HAD NO POLITICAL AFFILIATION
WHATSOEVER. THIS IS WHY WE CAN NOT SAY WITH ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY THAT
GUERRILLA GROUPS ARE OPERATING IN THE COUNTRY.

   THE FAL-ZARATE WILKA GROUP, WHICH CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS CRIME,
LEFT A HANDWRITTEN MESSAGE TO THE EFFECT THAT THEIR WAR IS TO KILL "THE
YANKEE INVADERS WHO COME HERE TO MASSACRE OUR PEASANT BROTHERS."

   REFERRING TO THE MESSAGE LEFT AT THE SCENE, THE INTERIOR MINISTER SAID
THAT AN INITIAL ANALYSIS OF THE MESSAGE REVEALS THAT IT WAS WRITTEN IN
LANGUAGUE NOT COMMONLY USED BY A LEFTIST POLITICAL ORGANIZATION.  THE
MESSAGE IS VAGUE WHEN IT REFERS TO BOTH NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND THE
EXPLOITATION OF PEASANTS.  THIS IS A CRIME IN WHICH DRUG TRAFFICKERS MIGHT
BE INVOLVED AND TO WHICH THEY WANT TO ATTACH A POLITICAL CONNOTATION," PEREZ
SAID.

   PEREZ ADDED THAT IN RECENT DAYS "THERE HAVE BEEN RUMORS THAT MEMBERS OF
THE U.S. ARMED FORCES HAVE COME TO BOLIVIA WITH PLANS TO FIGHT DRUG
TRAFFICKING.  WE HAVE TO REJECT THOSE RUMORS."

   HE SAID THAT THIS CRIME IS IN NO WAY LINKED TO THE PRESENCE OF "SHINING
PATH" TERRORISTS IN BOLIVIA.  HE SAID: "IF THIS TERRORIST GROUP IS OPERATING
IN BOLIVIA, IT SHOULD HAVE CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS CRIME, LIKE THE
NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY (ELN) DID IN THE 1960'S WHEN THEY REVEALED THAT
THEY CARRIED OUT TERRORIST ACTIVITIES ABROAD."

   PEREZ STATED THAT MURDER OF THE U.S. MORMON MISSIONARIES SHOULD BE
SERIUSLY ANALYZED SO THAT A RELIABLE REPORT IS RELEASED.

DEV-MUC3-0251 (INTEL TEXT PROC)

   SAN SALVADOR, 16 JUN 89 (RADIO CADENA YSKL) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY RENE HURTADO] [TEXT] HURTADO
PRESIDENT CRISTIANI THIS MORNING DELIVERED PART OF THE COFFEE TAX,
WHICH WILL BE DISTRIBUTED AMONG ALL THE MAYORS' OFFICES IN THE
COUNTRY.  AFTER THE EVENT AT A SAN SALVADOR HOTEL, CRISTIANI ANSWERED
QUESTIONS, FIRST ON THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
[FMLN] COMMUNIQUE DENYING PARTICIPATION IN THE MURDER OF PRESIDENCY
MINISTER JOSE ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ PORTH. IN THE COMMUNIQUE, THE FMLN
FLATLY DECLARED THAT NONE OF THEIR MEMBERS HAD HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH
THE MURDER.  CRISTIANI HAD THIS TO SAY:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND SAID THEY HAD
NOT ORDERED THE ASSASSINATION AND ADDED THAT APPARENTLY A GROUP GOT OUT OF
HAND AND PERPETRATED THE CRIME.  I THINK THE FMLN HAS REALIZED THE GENERAL
REPUDIATION THIS ACTION HAS ELICITED.  I AM CONVINCED THE FMLN IS TRYING TO
EXCUSE THE ACTION, THUS AVOIDING ALL RESPONSIBILITY.  WE THINK THEY ARE
TRYING TO SEEK A WAY OUT OF THE PROBLEM CAUSED BY THE ASSASSINATION OF AN
AGED, DEFENSELESS PERSON.  BUT THERE IS NO WAY OUT FOR THEM NOW.

   [HURTADO] THE FMLN HAS DENIED THAT ANY OF ITS MEMBERS PARTICIPATED IN THE
ACTION.

   [CRISTIANI] OF COURSE, THEY ARE NOW TRYING TO DENY IT AFTER THEY LEARNED
OF THE REPUDIATION BOTH HERE AND ABROAD.  IN ADDITION, THEY WAITED A
CONSIDERABLE TIME TO DENY THEIR PARTICIPATION.  THEY HAD A COMPLETE PLAN
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT.  AS YOU KNOW, THE PLAN IS CALLED "ALL AGAINST ARENA
[NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE]."  THIS MURDER WAS PART OF THEIR PLAN.
RODRIGUEZ PORTH HAD NO ENEMIES.  HE WAS A PEACEFUL MAN WHO STRUGGLED WITH
HIS PEN AND IDEAS. ONLY AN IRRATIONAL MIND, LIKE THAT OF THOSE WHO
ADVOCATE VIOLENCE, COULD HAVE CONCEIVED THIS ACTION.  I AM CONVINCED THE
FMLN DID IT.

   [HURTADO] MR PRESIDENT, IF YOU AND THE [WORDS INDISTINCT] ARE CONVINCED
THE FMLN IS GUILTY, WHAT WILL BECOME OF THE DIALOGUE?

   [CRITIANI] WE THINK WE SHOULD OVERCOME THE EFFECT OF THIS HEAVY BLOW
CAUSED BY THE LOSS, NOT ONLY OF A COLUMN OF THE PARTY AND OF OUR IDEOLOGY,
BUT ALSO OF A PERSONAL FRIEND.  AS MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT, WE SHOULD
OVERCOME OUR GRIEF AND SEEK THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY.  WE BELIEVE [WORDS
INDISTINCT] VIOLENCE IS REPUDIATED AND REJECTED IN THE COUNTRY.  IT IS TIME
FOR THE FMLN TO TALK ABOUT ITS OBJECTIVES.  THEY HAVE REJECTED THE
OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH THE GOVERNMENT WITH UNACCEPTABLE AND UNJUSTIFIABLE
ARGUMENTS.  BUT OUR PROPOSAL FOR DIALOGUE IS STILL GOOD.  WE ARE WILLING TO
SIT DOWN AND TALK WITH THEM SO THIS VIOLENCE CAN END.

   [HURTADO] HAS A COMMISSION ALREADY BEEN FORMED?  

   [CRISTIANI] WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF FORMING IT.  SOME OF THE PROPOSED
PERSONS HAVE ALREADY AGREED TO BE MEMBERS.  WE HOPE TO HAVE FORMED THE
COMMISSION BY THE END OF THE WEEK.  AS SOON AS WE HAVE IT, WE WILL GLADLY
ANNOUNCE THE MEMBERS' NAMES. [CONTINUED]

THE INCARNATE WORD IN A PRIVATE VEHICLE ALONG THE HIGHWAY BETWEEN SAN
SALVADOR AND ZARAGOZA, WHEN UNIDENTIFIED ASSAILANTS IN ANOTHER VEHICLE
OPENED FIRE.  JUANA MARGARITA FLORES, ONE OF THE NUNS TRAVELING WITH MAKEIL,
EXPLAINED THAT ONE OF THE BULLETS HIT MAKEIL NEAR THE RIGHT EAR.

   AFTER THE INCIDENT, THE NUNS TOOK MAKEIL TO SAN RAFAEL HOSPITAL IN SANTA

DEV-MUC3-0265 (INTEL TEXT PROC)

   TEGUCIGALPA, 27 JUN 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] AN ALLEGED SANDINIST
OFFICER WHO CLAIMS TO HAVE CARRIED OUT ESPIONAGE ACTIVITIES AGAINST THE
HONDURAN ARMED FORCES AND GOVERNMENT TURNED HIMSELF OVER TO HONDURAN
MILITARY AUTHORITIES TODAY.  

   THE INDIVIDUAL IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS CAPTAIN ADAN SOLORZANO MARTINEZ,
SAID HE HAD BEEN TRAINED IN CUBA IN 1980, AND SAID WAS IN HONDURAS ON AN
ESPIONAGE MISSION WITH TWO OTHER MEMBERS OF THE SANDINIST ARMY, WHOM HE DID
NOT IDENTIFY.

   SOLORZANO CALLED TOGETHER A GROUP OF NEWSMEN IN THE CITY OF SAN PEDRO
SULA, IN NORTHERN HONDURAS, AND TURNED HIMSELF OVER TO THE MILITARY
AUTHORITIES IN THE REPORTERS' PRESENCE.

   THE OFFICER DECLINED TO GIVE DETAILS ABOUT "DELICATE MATTERS" ABOUT WHICH
HE WILL BRIEF THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES.  HE SAID THEY CONCERN HIS
ACTIVITIES IN THIS COUNTRY SINCE MAY.

   THE DEFECTOR SAID HE ARRIVED IN HONDURAS IN AUGUST 1988 WITH AN
IDENTIFICATION CARD FROM THE HONDURAN NATIONAL REGISTRY OF PERSONS
IDENTIFYING HIM AS A HONDURAN FROM COMAYAGUA, IN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE
COUNTRY.

   HE TOLD THE PRESS HE HAS BEEN A SANDINIST SINCE 1974 AND HAD BEEN AN
URBAN GUERRILLA LEADER DURING THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE SOMOZIST REGIME IN
NICARAGUA.

   HE SAID THE DE FACTO GOVERNMENT AND THE CONTINUED RETENTION OF POWER BY
THE SANDINISTS FORCED HIM TO DEFECT.  HE ADDED THAT GROUPS OF SANDINISTS
HAVE BEEN INFILTRATED INTO TEGUCIGALPA, SAN PEDRO SULA, AND OTHER PARTS OF
HONDURAS TO CAUSE SOCIAL DESTABILIZATION.  

   HE EXPLAINED THAT AMONG OTHER ACTIVITIES, THEIR MISSION WAS TO KILL
LEADERS OF MASS ORGANIZATIONS AND THEN ATTRIBUTE THE DEATHS TO THE HONDURAN
ARMED FORCES, THEREBY FOMENTING SOCIAL DESTABILIZATION IN THE COUNTRY.

   HE ADDED THAT HIS CONTACTS WERE OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY AND THAT HE RECEIVED
$2,500 A MONTH TO CARRY OUT HIS ACTIVITIES IN HONDURAS.  

   THE DEFECTOR SAID SANDINIST OFFICERS DIRECT THE GUERRILLAS IN EL SALVADOR
AND THAT THE ASSASSINATION IN FEBRUARY OF GENERAL GUSTAVO ALVAREZ MARTINEZ,
FORMER COMMANDER OF THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES, WAS PLOTTED IN MANAGUA.

   THE DEFECTOR SAID ALVAREZ HAD ALWAYS BEEN IN THE SANDINISTS' SIGHTS
BECAUSE HE WAS THE MAIN PROMOTER OF THE CONTRAS (NICARAGUAN ARMED
OPPOSITION).

   SOLORZANO SAID NICARAGUAN FOREIGN MINISTER MIGUEL D'ESCOTO HAS MANY
"DELICATE THINGS" TO SAY AGAINST HONDURAS AND COSTA RICA.  [AS RECEIVED]

DEV-MUC3-0268 (INTEL TEXT PROC)

   LA PAZ, 29 JUN 89 (RADIO FIDES) -- [EXCERPTS] DIEGO MORALES, LEADER
OF COCHABAMBA'S PEASANT FEDERATION, IS SERIOUSLY INJURED AND IN A
COMA.  HE IS BEING TREATED AT A CHIMORE HOSPITAL.  UMOPAR [MOBILE
UNITS FOR RURAL AREAS] AGENTS FIRED MACHINEGUNS AT THE AREA FROM
HELICOPTERS TO SCARE THE LOCAL POPULATION AFTER COCA PRODUCERS BLOCKED
THE ROAD TO STOP AN UMOPAR VEHICLE TO FIRE.

   HUGO ZALAZAR FROM THE SINGLE TRADE UNION CONFEDERATION OF BOLIVIAN
PEASANT WORKERS SAID THAT UMOPAR AGENTS PROTECT DRUG TRAFFICKERS.  THE
CONFEDERATION WILL CONVENE A NATIONAL EMERGENCY MEETING TO PROTECT COCA
GROWERS FROM VIOLENT UMOPAR RAIDS.  [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   THE BOLIVIAN LABOR CONFEDERATION [COB] CONDEMEND THE RAIDS AND DENIED
THAT PEASANTS HAD AMBUSHED THE UMOPAR PATROL.  COB LEADER ALEJANDRO GUZMAN
REPORTS:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [GUZMAN] I MUST SAY THAT THE REPORT OF AN ALLEGED
AMBUSH IS COMPLETELY FALSE.  PEASANTS HAVE NOT CAPTURED UMOPAR OR DEA
HOSTAGES.  THERE WAS, HOWEVER, A VIOLENT ATTACK AGAINST COMPANERO DIEGO
MORALES ON HIS LAND, IN FRONT OF OTHER COCA GROWERS.  [END RECORDING]
[PASSAGE OMITTED]

   UMOPAR FORCES HAVE ALSO ARRESTED 30 PEASANTS IN PUERTO SAN FRANCISCO,
CHAPARE, AFTER A POLICE PATROL WAS FORCED TO RELEASE 2 DRUG TRAFFICKERS AND
HAD TO FLEE FROM A CROWD OF NEARLY 1,000 PEASANTS.

   SOCIAL DEFENSE UNDER SECRETARY GENARO MARQUEZ SAID THE INCIDENT OCCURRED
AFTER A MINE-MAN UMOPAR PATROL CAPTURED TWO DRUG TRAFFICKERS.  THE PEASANTS
INTERCEPTED THE VEHICLE IN WHICH THE TWO DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE BEING TAKEN TO
CHIMORE.  THE POLICE AGENTS HAD TO RELEASE THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS AFTER THE
PEASANTS THREATENED TO SHOOT THEM.  

   THE CROWD CONTINUED TO THREATEN THE PATROL, FORCING THE UMOPAR AGENTS TO
FLEE INTO THE WOODS.  THE PEASANTS -- SOME 400 STRONG -- BURNED THE UMOPAR
PICKUP AND CHASED THE POLICE INTO THE WOODS.

   UNDER SECRETARY GENARO MARQUEZ EXPLAINTS:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MARQUEZ] YESTERDAY, UMOPAR RAIDED SOME AREAS DURING
THE MORNING AND CLASHED WITH A LARGE GROUP OF PEASANTS IN PUERTO SAN
FRANCISCO, WHO ATTACKED THE PATROL AFTER LEARNING WHAT HAPPENED TO DIEGO
MORALES.  THE AGENTS HAD TO RELEASE TWO DRUG TRAFFICKERS THEY WERE
BRINGING WITH THEM.  THEY WERE ABLE TO FLEE THE AREA AFTER SOME
DIFFICULTIES BUT WILL CONTINUE INVESTIGATING.  [PASSAGE OMITTED] [END
RECORDING]

   MARQUEZ SAID THE 30 ARRESTED PEASANTS WILL BE QUESTIONED TO DETERMINE
THEIR RESPONSIBILITY IN THE INCIDENT AND THOSE WHO ARE INNOCENT WILL BE
RELEASED.  MARQUEZ ALSO SAID POLICE SEIZED ARMS AND STICKS OF DYNAMITE.

DEV-MUC3-0271 (INTEL TEXT PROC)

   SAN SALVADOR, 30 JUN 89 (CANAL SEIS TELEVISION) -- [TEXT]
SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI HAS BLAMED FMLN [FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] GUERRILLAS FOR THE MURDER OF
POLITICAL ANALYST EDGAR CHACON AND HAS STRESSED THAT, DESPITE THESE
ACTIONS, HE IS UNDETERRED FROM HIS INTENTION TO SIT DOWN AND TALK WITH
THE REBELS TO PUT AN END TO THE CONFLICT.

   PRESIDENT CRISTIANI SAID THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT BE BLACKMAILED BY
THE WAVE OF VIOLENCE UNLEASHED BY THE FMLN.  THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT THESE
ACTIONS ONLY SERVE TO CONFIRM THE WEAKNESS OF THE FMLN, WHICH SEEKS POWER
THROUGH VIOLENCE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] THE FMLN'S POWERLESSNESS AND INABILITY TO DO
BATTLE USING IDEAS RATHER THAN VIOLENCE BECAME EVIDENT AGAIN TODAY.  THE
FMLN HAS AGAIN TRIED TO SILENCE THE VOICE OF ANOTHER SALVADORAN WHO FOUGHT
WITH WORDS AND THOUGHTS.  IN EVERY SENSE, THIS HAS BEEN A COWARDLY ACT AND
IT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS THAT.  IT IS THE WORK OF SICK MINDS.  I BELIEVE
THAT THIS IS WHAT THE FMLN HAS PROVEN TO BE -- A GROUP OF SICK PEOPLE WHO DO
NOT UNDERSTAND THE CLAMOR OF A PEOPLE WHO WISH TO TALK RATHER THAN USE
VIOLENCE, A PEOPLE WHO WANT PEACE IN EL SALVADOR.  

   WE ARE ON THE SIDE OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, AND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE
WANT US TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO ACHIEVE PEACE IN EL SALVADOR.  BECAUSE WE WISH
TO DO WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT, WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE THE DOORS OPEN IN THE HOPE
OF ACHIEVING PEACE IN OUR HOMELAND. [END RECORDING]

   SAN SALVADOR, 2 JUL 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] IN AN ATTACK THAT OCCURRED
NEAR SAN SALVADOR A GROUP OF UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS THIS EVENING WOUNDED
MAURICIO GUTIERREZ CASTRO, PRESIDENT OF THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE.  ONE
OF HIS BODYGUARDS WAS WAS KILLED.  

   THE PRESIDENT OF THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE, WHO TOOK OFFICE ON FRIDAY,
WAS SLIGHTLY WOUNDED IN THE NECK.

   GUTIERREZ CASTRO, A 48-YEAR-OLD MAN, WAS RETURNING TO SAN SALVADOR FROM
THE BEACH IN LA LIBERTAD WHEN HIS CAR WAS SHOT AT NEAR THE TOWN OF ZARAGOZA,
APPROXIMATELY 10 KM FROM SAN SALVADOR.  GUTIERREZ CASTRO WAS IN THE CAR WITH
HIS TWO SONS.

   ONE OF HIS BODYGUARDS, WHOM THE AUTHORITIES DID NOT IDENTIFY, DIED ON THE
SPOT, WHILE HIS CHILDREN AND THE OTHER MEMBER OF HIS ESCORT WERE NOT INJURED.

   IN A DECLARATION IN WHICH HE CONDEMNED ALL TYPES OF VIOLENCE IN THE
COUNTRY, "REGARDLESS OF WHERE IT COMES FROM," THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE
PRESIDENT TOLD THE MEDIA THAT HE DID NOT KNOW IF HE WAS THE TARGET OF THE
ATTACK.

   GUTIERREZ CASTRO REPLACES FRANCISCO JOSE GUERRERO, WHO COMPLETED HIS
5-YEAR TERM.

   NO ORGANIZATION HAS YET CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK.

   THE LAST ATTACK WITH SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS OCCURRED IN JUNE, AND THE
AUTHORITIES ATTRIBUTED IT TO THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
(FMLN), BUT THE GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION DENIED THE ACCUSATION.

   ON THAT OCCASION THREE UNIDENTIFIED MEN SHOT AND KILLED 65-YEAR- OLD
PRESIDENCY MINISTER ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ PORTH.

DEV-MUC3-0278 (INTEL TEXT PROC)

   BOGOTA, 3 JUL 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] ARMED FORCES COMMANDER GENERAL OSCAR
BOTERO RESTREPO REPORTED TODAY THAT GUERRILLAS OF THE PRO - CASTRO ARMY OF
NATIONAL LIBERATION (ELN) SET FIRE TO THREE TANK TRUCKS THAT WERE CARRYING
OIL FROM THE CANO LIMON OILFIELD IN ARAUCA DEPARTMENT, WHICH BORDERS
VENEZUELA, TO COLOMBIA'S INTERIOR.  

   THE ATTACK WAS CARRIED OUT IN BOQUERON, BETWEEN PAJARITO AND YOPAL, IN
CASANARE DEPARTMENT, WHERE THE SUBVERSIVES HAVE UNLEASHED A VIOLENT CAMPAIGN
AGAINST COLOMBIA'S OIL INFRASTRUCTURE TO FORCE THEIR DEMANDS FOR THE
NATIONALIZATION OF THE OIL INDUSTRY.

   GEN BOTERO SAID THAT THE REBELS -- WHO HAVE DYNAMITED THE COUNTRY'S MAIN
OIL PIPELINE, THE CANO LIMON - CONVENAS PIPELINE, 23 TIMES THUS FAR THIS
YEAR -- INTERCEPTED THE VEHICLES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY AND SET THEM
ON FIRE AFTER FORCING THE DRIVERS TO GET OUT OF THE VEHICLES.  THE ELN
GUERRILLAS SIMULTANEOUSLY WROTE SLOGANS IN SUPPORT OF THE SO-CALLED SIMON
BOLIVAR NATIONAL GUERRILLA COORDINATING BOARD.  DURING THE LAST FEW HOURS,
THIS GROUP AGREED WITH PRESIDENT BARCO'S ADMINISTRATION TO BEGIN A DIRECT
DIALOGUE TO SEEK PEACE IN COLOMBIA.  

   NO DEATHS WERE REPORTED IN THE ATTACK BY THE ELN, WHICH WAS FOUNDED
DURING THE 1960'S AND IS LED BY MANUEL PEREZ, A SPANISH PRIEST.

   MEANWHILE, ANOTHER COMMANDO GROUP FROM THE CAMILIST UNION (NAMED IN
MEMORY OF COLOMBIAN PRIEST CAMILO RESTREPO, WHO WAS KILLED BY SOLDIERS IN
1966 WHILE STILL A MEMBER OF THE ELN), AMBUSHED A MILITARY PATROL ON THE
AGUA AZUL - TERRANOVA HIGHWAY, ALSO IN CASANARE, KILLING TWO SOLDIERS.  GEN
BOTERO SAID THAT TWO SOLDIERS STEPPED ON A MINE DURING THE GUERRILLA ATTACK
AND THREE OTHER SOLDIERS WERE WOUNDED.

DEV-MUC3-0286 (INTEL TEXT PROC)

   MOSCOW (USSR), 7 JUL 89 (IZVESTIYA) -- [REPORT] [V. ZAYKIN] [TEXT]
THIRTYTHREE SOVIET SEAMEN HAVE BEEN INJURED IN THE PERUVIAN PORT OF
CALLAO AS A RESULT OF AN EXPLOSION CAUSED BY A BOMB PLANTED UNDER A
BUS STANDING IN THE STREET.

   OUR CORRESPONDENT TELEPHONED THE USSR MINISTRY OF THE FISH INDUSTRY AND
ASKED FOR INFORMATION ON THE INCIDENT.

   "IT HAPPENED ON 5 JULY AT 1010 HOURS LOCAL TIME," S. SVINARENKO, DEPUTY
CHIEF OF THE USSR MINISTRY OF THE FISH INDUSTRY FOREIGN RELATIONS
ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT, SAID.  "SIXTEEN SEAMEN HAD TO BE HOSPITALIZED.
FORTUNATELY, NO ONE WAS SERIOUSLY HURT.  THE SEAMEN MAINLY SUFFERED
FRACTURES, CUTS, AND BURNS.  THE VICTIMS WERE MEMBERS OF THE CREWS OF TWO
LARGE, AUTONOMOUS TRAWLERS -- THE 'VLADIMIR KURASOV' AND THE 'LAZURNYY' --
WHO WERE ON SHORE LEAVE THAT DAY.

   "OUR SEAMEN ARE WORKING IN THIS REGION ON THE BASIS OF AN AGREEMENT ON
COOPERATION BETWEEN PERU AND THE SOVIET UNION.  WE ASSIST THE PERUVIANS IN
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR FISHING INDUSTRY, GET OUR SHIPS REPAIRED IN LOCAL
PORTS, AND FISH WITHIN A 200-MILE ZONE OF THAT COUNTRY...."

   REUTER AND AFP HAVE REPORTED THAT, IN THE OPINION OF THE CALLAO POLICE,
THE EXPLOSION WAS ORGANIZED BY THE "SENDERO LUMINOSO," A REBEL GROUP OF
MAOIST PERSUASION.  "THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT THAT THIS ACT, WHICH
DESERVES TO BE CONDEMNED, WAS DIRECTED AGAINST TOTALLY INNOCENT CITIZENS,"
PERUVIAN FOREIGN MINISTER GUILLERMO LARCO COX SAID.

   THE SOVIET SEAMEN WERE ON A BUS WHICH HAD STOPPED AT A STORE WHEN THE
BOMB, PLANTED UNDER AN EMPTY BUS STANDING NEARBY, WAS DETONATED.

   ACCORDING TO EYE WITNESSES, FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE WEARING SCHOOL UNIFORM WERE
SEEN AT THE SCENE OF THE INCIDENT A FEW MOMENTS BEFORE THE EXPLOSION,
PLACING A PACKAGE UNDER THE BUS.  

   "SENDERO LUMINOSO" IS AN EXTREME LEFT-WING REBEL ORGANIZATION WAGING A
GUERRILLA WAR AGAINST THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT.  

   "SENDERO LUMINOSO" HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS.  IT
BEGAN ITS ARMED STRUGGLE IN 1980.  SINCE THEN, PERU HAS KNOWN NO PEACE.
REPORTS OF MURDERS AND ACTS OF SABOTAGE COMMITTED BY THIS ORGANIZATION ARE
APPEARING WITH INCREASING FREQUENCY IN THE WORLD PRESS.  THE TERRORISTS'
VICTIMS ARE POLITICIANS, MEMBERS OF THE POLICE FORCE, SOLDIERS,
PEASANTS....  THE TERRORISTS OFTEN INVOLVE JUVENILES IN THEIR ACTS OF
SABOTAGE.

   THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN FORCED TO RELY MORE AND MORE EXTENSIVELY
ON THE ARMED FORCES IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THIS TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.
BUT SO FAR THIS HAS FAILED TO PRODUCE TANGIBLE RESULTS.

DEV-MUC3-0299 (INTEL TEXT PROC)

   CLANDESTINE, 18 JUL 89 (RADIO FARABUNDO MARTI) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN)] [TEXT] CONCERNING
MONDAY'S INCIDENTS NEAR EL SALVADOR UNIVERSITY, THE FMLN STATES:

   1. NONE OF OUR UNITS WERE OPERATING AROUND EL SALVADOR UNIVERSITY OR THE
NORTHERN SECTOR OF THE CAPITAL ON THAT DAY.

   2. THE CLASHES THAT OCCURRED NEAR THE UNIVERSITY WERE CARRIED OUT BY
ARMED FORCES TROOPS ALONE.  IN AN EFFORT TO SEARCH THE UNIVERSITY, THE
TROOPS FIRED THEIR WEAPONS [WORDS INDISTINCT] AS STUDENT DEMONSTRATORS WERE
ENTERING THE CAMPUS.

   3. THIS ACTION IS PART OF A PLAN THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AND THE TOP
COMMAND OF THE ARMED FORCES ARE PROMOTING AGAINST EL SALVADOR UNIVERSITY.
THIS PLAN IS BEING CARRIED OUT BY COLONEL FRANCISCO ELENA FUENTES, COMMANDER
OF THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE.  THE PLAN INVOLVES THREATS, ARRESTS, MURDERS,
AND OTHER REPRESSIVE ACTS.  

   4. IT IS PREDICTABLE THAT THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AND THE TOP COMMAND OF
THE ARMED FORCES WILL SAY THAT WHAT OCCURRED AT THE UNIVERSITY WAS THE
RESULT OF A CLASH BETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE FMLN, AND THIS IS COMPLETELY
FALSE.  CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE VIOLENT INCIDENTS THAT CLAIMED SEVERAL VICTIMS IN THE AREA AROUND EL
SALVADOR UNIVERSITY.  

   [SIGNED] [FMLN, EL SALVADOR, 17 JULY 1989]

   SAN SALVADOR, 22 JUL 89 (RADIO CADENA YSKL) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE, COPREFA] [TEXT] THE
SALVADORAN NATIONAL POLICE REPORTED THIS MORNING THAT UNIDENTIFIED MEN
SET OFF BOMBS AT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN JOSE SIMEON CANAS UNIVERSITY,
UCA, LOCATED IN SOUTHWESTERN SAN SALVADOR.

   ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE AT 0200.  ONE
ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE, ONE BUS, AND ONE ELECTRICAL TRANSFORMER WERE DAMAGED
AS A RESULT OF THE EXPLOSION OF AT LEAST FOUR BOMBS THAT WENT OFF INSIDE THE
UCA CAMPUS.

   THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ALWAYS CONDEMNED THIS KIND OF ATTACK, WHICH IS
USUALLY CARRIED OUT BY CERTAIN GROUPS THAT OPPOSE PEACE. THE ARMED FORCES
BELIEVE THAT SUCH ATTACKS ARE NOT THE WAY TO SOLVE THE COUNTRY'S SOCIAL AND
POLITICAL PROBLEMS.

   IN ADDITION, THESE VIOLENT ACTIONS ONLY CONFUSE THE PUBLIC, BECAUSE
UNSCRUPULOUS PEOPLE ALWAYS BLAME THE ARMY FOR ANY SUCH ACTION, WITHOUT FIRST
CONDUCTING AN IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION OF THE ORIGIN OF THE ATTACKS.

   THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ALWAYS REITERATED THEIR WILLINGNESS TO ENSURE
RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PROPERTY, AND THE LIFE AND
SAFETY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  THEREFORE, FROM THIS VERY MOMENT, THE
ARMED FORCES REJECT ANY ACCUSATION IMPLICATING THEM IN THE ATTACK AGAINST
UCA, WHICH TOOK PLACE EARLY THIS MORNING.

   GUATEMALA CITY, 1 AUG 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] GUATEMALAN
PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO SAID TODAY THAT DANILO BARILLAS, FORMER
AMBASSADOR AND LEADER OF THE RULING CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY [PDC],
WAS THE "VICTIM OF THE POLITICAL INTOLERANCE OF GROUPS WHO DO NOT WANT
TO LIVE IN DEMOCRACY."

   IN STATEMENTS TO NEWSMEN, CEREZO SAID THAT THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR KILLING
BARILLAS "ARE EXTREME RIGHTIST GROUPS SEEKING TO DESTABILIZE THE DEMOCRATIC
PROCESS BEGUN ON 14 JANUARY 1986," AFTER 2 DECADES OF MILITARY REGIMES.

   POLICE SOURCES REPORTED THAT BARILLAS, AMBASSADOR TO SPAIN DURING THE
FIRST 2 YEARS OF CEREZO'S ADMINISTRATION, WHICH BEGAN IN 1986, WAS GUNNED
DOWN BY UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS AS HE WAS RETURNING TO HIS HOME IN THE SOUTHERN
PART OF THE CAPITAL AFTER TAKING ONE OF HIS DAUGHTERS TO A NEARBY BUS STOP.

   OFFICIAL REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE ATTACKERS, WHO WERE TRAVELING IN TWO
VEHICLES WITH TINTED WINDOWS, HAD BEEN WAITING FOR BARILLAS SINCE VERY EARLY
IN THE MORNING.  DE POLITICAL LEADER MANAGED TO AVOID THE FIRST SHOTS THAT
WERE FIRED AT HIM AND TOOK REFUGE UNDER A PARKED CAR, WHERE THE ASSAILANTS
PUMPED 6 ROUNDS INTO HIM.

   BARILLAS, 50, WAS SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PDC FROM 1970 TO 1974.

   PRESIDENT CEREZO AND ALFONSO CABRERA, PDC SECRETARY AND
PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL FOR THAT PARTY, WENT TO BARILLAS' HOME WHERE THEY
VEHEMENTLY CONDEMNED THE CRIME.

   CABRERA TERMED THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE KILLING "COWARDS," AND SAID THAT
THE CRIME IS PART OF A TERRORIST WAVE THAT HAS GRIPPED GUATEMALA FOR OVER 15
DAYS.  

   BARILLAS WAS A MEMBER OF THE GUATEMALAN DELEGATION THAT PARTICIPATED IN A
MEETING WITH LEADERS OF THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY (URNG)
HELD IN MADRID, SPAIN, IN OCTOBER 1987, WHEN HE WAS AMBASSADOR TO THAT
EUROPEAN COUNTRY.

   AFTER LEAVING THAT POST LAST YEAR HE WAS APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT CEREZO AS
DIRECTOR OF THE SO-CALLED "METROPOLITAN DEVELOPMENT COUNCILS," WHICH PROVIDE
REFUGE FOR PEASANTS AFFECTED BY THE COUNTERINSURGENCY STRUGGLE.

   BOGOTA, 2 AUG 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] IN AN UNPRECEDENTED MOVE IN COLOMBIA'S
RECENT HISTORY, THE PATRIOTIC UNION [UP] TOOK OVER THIS EVENING THE MAIN
OFFICES OF THE INTERIOR MINISTRY IN BOGOTA AND TOLD THE GOVERNMENT THAT THEY
WILL NOT LEAVE UNTIL A GOVERNMENT MEETING IS CONVENED TO ANALYZE THE UPSURGE
IN VIOLENCE AGAINST UP MEMBERS.

   THE UP, THE COUNTRY'S THIRD-RANKING POLITICAL FORCE, LOST ABOUT 950 OF

ADVISOR ABELARDO DAZA WAS SHOT.  

   THE TAKEOVER IS BY UP PRESIDENT BERNARDO JARAMILLO, VICE PRESIDENT DIEGO
MONTANA, SECRETARY CARLOS ROMERO, AND TREASURER OSCAR DUENAS, WHO ASK THAT
PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S GOVERNMENT DISCLOSE THE RESULTS OF THE FIGHT TO
COMBAT THE RIGHT-WING SQUADS AND THE "TRUE BEHAVIOR" OF SOME MILITARY AND
POLICE LEADERS IN SOME AREAS OF THE COUNTRY.

   JARAMILLO, WHO RECENTLY DENOUNCED BEFORE EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN ENTITIES
COLOMBIA'S "DIRTY WAR," SAID THAT "THE UP AND PUBLIC OPINION NEED TO KNOW
WHY GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA [ONE OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL LEADERS ACCUSED OF
FINANCING AND MASTERMINDING THE MURDERS OF POLITICAL LEADERS] AND OTHER WELL
KNOWN CRIMINALS HAVE NOT BEEN CAUGHT."

   JARAMILLO ADDED: "WE DO NOT WANT MORE BODYGUARDS, BUT THE POLITICAL
RESOLVE TO DISMANTLE THE GANG OF HIRED GUNMEN AND ARREST THEIR LEADERS."

DEV-MUC3-0338 (BBN)

   SAN SALVADOR, 9 AUG 89 (RADIO CADENA YSKL) -- [REPORT] [ROSSIE
CASTILLO] [TEXT] NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEPUTY MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON
SAID TODAY THAT THE POSITION ADOPTED BY EL SALVADOR THROUGH PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI AT THE SUMMIT IN TELA, HONDURAS, IS POSITIVE BECAUSE
EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE TO ACHIEVE PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA.  HOWEVER,
HE SAID THAT THE POSITION OF THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT] WILL ACTUALLY BE VERY CRITICAL NOW.  THE FMLN WILL
NOT LOOK GOOD INTERNATIONALLY IF IT REJECTS THE DIALOGUE.

   HERE IS AN EXCERPT OF D'AUBUISSON'S STATEMENTS, IN WHICH HE ALSO REVEALED
THAT COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS HAS OFFERED TO MEDIATE THE DIALOGUE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [D'AUBUISSON, IN PROGRESS] ... FALLACIES. THIS IS
NOT THE FIRST TIME THEY HAVE CLAIMED TO WANT SOMETHING AND ENDED UP
DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT.  THEY ARE GOING TO TRY TO IMPROVE THEIR
INTERNATIONAL IMAGE AND DO NOT WANT TO LOOK LIKE [WORD INDISTINCT]
BEFORE THE LITTLE MANGY-DOGS WHO GO ABOUT PLANTING BOMBS HERE.  THEY
WANT TO DEMONSTRATE PERHAPS THAT THEY ALWAYS HOLD A HEGEMONIC POSITION
HERE AND WILL TRY TO OBTAIN A BETTER NEGOTIATING POSITION FOR THEIR
ILLEGAL FORCES, WHICH ARE STILL GOING AROUND [WORD INDISTINCT] AND
KILLING PEOPLE [WORDS INDISTINCT].

   [CASTILLO] NEVERTHELESS, MAJOR, DO YOU VIEW THIS MEETING AS POSITIVE
[WORD INDISTINCT] WITH THE FMLN -- THAT IS, THE DIALOGUE -- NOW THAT
SOMETHING TANGIBLE HAS COME OUT OF THE SUMMIT?  DO YOU THINK PEACE CAN BE
ACHIEVED?

   [D'AUBUISSON] THE OBJECTIVE OF ALL SALVADORANS -- AND IN THIS REGARD WE
SPEAK FROM THE HEART -- IS TO ACHIEVE PEACE.  IF THE FMLN COOPERATES, WE
WELCOME ITS COOPERATION.  HOWEVER, IF IT DOES NOT COOPERATE, THERE WILL BE
FMLN MEMBERS WHO WILL DEMOBILIZE, THE SAME WAY SO MANY PEOPLE FROM THE [WORD
INDISTINCT] ARE DESERTING.  THESE PEOPLE HAD TO BE GIVEN GUARANTEES.  WE
WILL SEE LATER IF, AS THEY SAY, THEY ARE TRULY WORKING, OR STRUGGLING, FOR
THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE [WORDS INDISTINCT] MORE POSITIVE ACTIONS.

   HOWEVER, WE SEE EVERYTHING AS BEING WELL ON THE WAY TO ACHIEVING PEACE IN
A SHORT TIME.  [END RECORDING]

   D'AUBUISSON SAID THAT IF THE FMLN DOES NOT AGREE TO THE DEMOBILIZATION,
THE FMLN MEMBERS WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE IF PEACE IS NOT ACHIEVED.
REGARDING THE COMMISSION, HE SAID IT IS ALREADY BEING ORGANIZED AND WILL
BEGIN A DIALOGUE SOON.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [D'AUBUISSON, IN PROGRESS] ...A CONTINUOUS
DIALOGUE TO FIND SOLUTIONS.  THAT IS WHY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI HAS
INSTRUCTED THAT IT HAVE NO PRIOR AGENDA BUT THAT IT JUST BEGIN.  THEIR
FIRST STEP SHOULD BE TO SIT DOWN AT A TABLE TO TALK, TO NEGOTIATE, TO
ENGAGE IN DIALOGUE.  AND THIS IS TO GO ON CONTINUOUSLY UNTIL SOLUTIONS
ARE FOUND AND THEY ACHIEVE SOMETHING TANGIBLE, WHICH IS THE FINAL
SOLUTION.

   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] 

   [D'AUBUISSON] WELL, FOR EXAMPLE, COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT ARIAS HAS
OFFERED TO ACT AS MEDIATOR OR INTERMEDIARY.  HE SAID THAT IF THE
COMMISSION GOES TO SAN JOSE, HE WILL TAKE IT UPON HIMSELF TO INVITE
THESE GENTLEMEN TOO AND TO GIVE THEM WHATEVER THEY NEED FOR THIS
MEETING TO BEGIN.  AFTER THAT, THEY THEMSELVES WILL DEVELOP THE
MECHANISMS.  [END RECORDING]

   MAJ D'AUBUISSON SAID THE COMMISSION WILL BE SWORN IN AND WILL MAINTAIN AN
ONGOING DIALOGUE WITH THE FMLN REPRESENTATIVES.

   COMMENTING ON LEGISLATIVE WORK, HE SAID THAT TODAY THE POLITICAL
COMMITTEE WILL MEET TO ELECT THE PRESIDENT OF THE COMMISSION ON CORRUPTION,
WHICH HAD BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY NEGLECTED BY DR JAIME VENTURA.  THE ONLY
CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE COMMISSION ON CORRUPTION IS DEPUTY
ROBERTO ANGULO, VICE PRESIDENT AND ACTING PRESIDENT OF THE LEGISLATIVE
ASSEMBLY.

DEV-MUC3-0350 (BBN)

   BOGOTA, 18 AUG 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [SPEECH]
[COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS] [TEXT] FELLOW COUNTRYMEN:
I AM ADDRESSING YOU TO EXPLAIN THE MEASURES UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF
THE STATE OF SIEGE [MEDIDAS DE ESTADO DE SITIO] WHICH HAVE BEEN
ADOPTED AT A TIME WHEN THE NATION HAS JUSTIFIED REASONS TO FEEL ANGRY
AND MOVED BY THE SERIOUS ACTIONS OF VIOLENCE THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN
RECENT DAYS.  UNFORTUNATELY, LUIS CARLOS GALAN, THE LIBERAL PARTY
PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL, WAS THE VICTIM OF ANOTHER ATTACK TONIGHT.
SENATOR GALAN HAS BEEN TAKEN TO A HOSPITAL.  LET US PRAY TO GOD THAT
HE WILL RECOVER FROM HIS WOUNDS.

   THE CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS AND THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS HAVE UNLEASHED A
WAVE OF ASSASSINATIONS AND DEATHS.  THERE HAVE BEEN ATTACKS AGAINST
REPRESENTATIVES AND LEADERS FROM ALL SECTORS OF THE COUNTRY AND FROM ALL
INSTITUTIONS.  HIGH-RANKING GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, SEVERAL JUDGES, POLITICAL
LEADERS, SOLDIERS, CITIZENS, AND PUBLIC OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN THE VICTIMS OF
THIS BARBARISM.

   VIOLENCE AFFECTS ALL.  IT IS NOT AN OFFENSIVE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OR
AGAINST JUSTICE; IT IS A WAR AGAINST THE COUNTRY.  THEREFORE, THE ENTIRE
COUNTRY MUST RESPOND.  I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW THE MURDER OF MAGISTRATE CARLOS
VALENCIA LED THE JUDGES OF THE REPUBLIC TO PROTEST AND TO REQUEST MORE
PROTECTION, BUT FOR THE MAGISTRATES AND JUDGES TO RESIGN ONLY CONTRIBUTES TO
WORSENING THE SITUATION WHICH WE MUST ALL SOLVE BY WORKING TOGETHER.  THIS
IS ALSO EQUIVALENT TO YIELDING TO THE TERRORISTS WHO ARE TRYING TO PARALYZE
THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.

   TRUE HEROES SUCH AS CARLOS VALENCIA, WALDEMAR FRANKLIN QUINTERO, AND
OTHER JUDGES, POLICEMEN, SOLDIERS, AND BODYGUARDS HAVE PREVENTED THIS BY
FULFILLING THEIR DUTIES WITHOUT YIELDING TO INTIMIDATION OR BRIBERY.  I
INVITE ALL JUDGES OF THE REPUBLIC TO RESUME THEIR WORK.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS
ADOPTED MORE MEASURES TO PROTECT THEM, AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO RENDER ALL
THE COOPERATION THEY REQUIRE AND WHICH IS AVAILABLE.  ALL GOOD COLOMBIANS
MUST JOIN THE EFFORTS.  NO MORE LAMENTATIONS WITHOUT TRUE ACTION OF
COOPERATION WITH THE AUTHORITIES.

   IT IS NECESSARY THAT ALL FORCES OF THE STATE AND OF SOCIETY -- POLITICAL
PARTIES, UNIONS, MEDIA, CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS -- ALL SERVE JUSTICE AND THE
STRUGGLE AGAINST CRIME.  WE MUST BE PREPARED TO ENDURE MORE SORROW AND
SUFFERINGS.  ONLY IF ALL COLOMBIA PERSEVERES IN A TRULY STRONG AND SOLID
MANNER -- BUT NOT JUST WITH WORDS -- IN THE DIFFICULT BATTLE AGAINST CRIME,
WILL WE BE ABLE TO BANISH VIOLENCE.  [CONTINUED]

   BOGOTA, 19 AUG 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] GENERAL MIGUEL MAZA, CHIEF OF THE
COLOMBIAN SECRET POLICE, WARNED THE COUNTRY TODAY THAT THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS
"WILL CONTINUE TO SHOOT," AND ANNOUNCED AN ALL-OUT DECLARATION OF WAR
AGAINST THEM.

   MAZA, WHO 1 MONTH AGO ESCAPED MIRACULOUSLY FROM A CAR BOMB ATTACK STAGED
BY THE DRUG MAFIA, WARNED ABOUT THE "WAR" THAT THE "DRUG LORDS" HAVE
UNLEASHED AGAINST THE COUNTRY, NOTING THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO FIRE THEIR
WEAPONS.

   THE POLICE CHIEF DECLARED THAT THE STATE ORGANIZATIONS FIGHTING
CRIMINALITY WILL STRUGGLE AGAINST THOSE WHO SEEK BY THEIR CRIMINAL ACTIONS
TO IMPOSE THEIR OWN LAWS.

   ALSO, MAZA DIRECTLY ACCUSED THE DRUG CARTELS OF BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
CHAIN OF ASSASSINATIONS THAT HAVE SHAKEN THE COUNTRY OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS.

   "WE ALL KNOW WHO THEY ARE AND WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT THEM," HE WARNED.

   THE SEVERE MEASURES ADOPTED LAST NIGHT BY THE GOVERNMENT OF
LIBERAL PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO, AFTER THE KILLINGS DURING THE PAST 72
HOURS OF A JUDGE, A POLICE COMMANDER, AND PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL LUIS CARLOS
GALAN, WILL PERMIT THE SECURITY CORPS TO FORCEFULLY CONFRONT THE WAVE OF
VIOLENCE THAT HAS GRIPPED COLOMBIA, HE DECLARED.

DEV-MUC3-0361 (BBN)

   BOGOTA, 21 AUG 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] EDUARDO MARTINEZ ROMERO, THE ALLEGED
"COMPTROLLER" OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, WAS CAPTURED BY COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES
TODAY DURING THE RAID ON A FARM IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY, IT WAS
REPORTED IN BOGOTA.

   IT WAS LEARNED THAT THE ARREST OF MARTINEZ ROMERO, THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE
SINCE THE ARMY AND POLICE LAUNCHED AN OFFENSIVE AGAINST THE DRUG TRAFFICKING
MAFIA LAST SATURDAY, OCCURRED ON A FARM NEAR TOLU MUNICIPALITY IN SUCRE
DEPARTMENT.

   ABOUT 24 PEOPLE WERE ALSO ARRESTED ALONG WITH THE MEDELLIN CARTEL
MEMBER.  THE CARTEL IS THE LARGEST WORLD COCAINE TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATION,
WHICH STAGED A SERIES OF VIOLENT ACTIONS LAST WEEK.

   IN FACT, MERCENARIES OF THAT CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION ASSASSINATED IN LESS
THAN 48 HOURS, MAGISTRATE CARLOS VALENCIA GARCIA, ANTIOQUIA POLICE COMMANDER
COLONEL WALDEMAR FRANKLIN QUINTERO, AND SENATOR AND PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL
LUIS CARLOS GALAN, WHO ACCORDING TO THE POLLS, WAS THE FAVORITE TO SUCCEED
VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS AS PRESIDENT.

   MARTINEZ ROMERO, ONE OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS MOST WANTED BY THE U.S. DRUG
ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION (DEA), HAD MANAGED TO EVADE A PLAN TO CAPTURE HIM
IN PANAMA CITY LAST 29 MARCH.

   UNOFFICIAL REPORTS IN BOGOTA INDICATE THAT THE WELL-KNOWN MAFIA MEMBER
COULD BE THE FIRST TO BE EXTRADITED TO THE UNITED STATES, IN KEEPING WITH
THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT'S NEW PROVISIONS ADOPTED IN VIEW OF THE WAVE OF
VIOLENCE.  THESE PROVISIONS AUTHORIZE THE EXTRADITION OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS TO
OTHER COUNTRIES WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH THE JUSTICE TRIBUNALS.

   ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL REPORTS, MORE THAN 11,000 PEOPLE RELATED TO THE
MAFIA HAVE BEEN ARRESTED IN THE INTENSE OPERATIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE
COLOMBIAN ARMY AND POLICE, IN THE LARGEST OFFENSIVE EVER LAUNCHED BY
COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES AGAINST THE DRUG TRAFFICKING BANDS.

   THE ACTIONS ARE BEING CARRIED OUT ESPECIALLY IN THE DEPARTMENTS OF
ANTIOQUIA, CUNDINAMARCA, AND VALLE DEL CAUCA, WHERE SO-CALLED ELITE PATROLS
HAVE TAKEN OVER EXTENSIVE AND SWANK PROPERTIES OWNED BY PABLO ESCOBAR
GAVIRIA AND GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, THE "DRUG LORDS" OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL.

   REPORTS TODAY INDICATE THAT ONE OF THE PRIVATE HOMES BELONGING TO
RODRIGUEZ GACHA, ALIAS "THE MEXICAN," WAS RAIDED IN BOGOTA.

DEV-MUC3-0362 (BBN)

   BUENOS AIRES, 21 AUG 89 (TELAM) -- [TEXT] ARGENTINA HAS EXPRESSED ITS
SOLIDARITY WITH THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE DURING TODAY'S OAS
SESSION.  THE OAS ALSO EXPRESSED ITS "CONSTERNATION OVER AND REPUDIATION OF"
THE RECENT TERRORIST ACTIONS IN THAT COUNTRY, AND STRESSED THE "INDOMITABLE
COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT DECISION TO FIGHT AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING AND RELATED
ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES."

   THE OAS HELD A "SPECIAL AND URGENT" SESSION TODAY AT THE REQUEST OF
COLOMBIAN AMBASSADOR LEOPOLDO VILLAR, WHO WANTED TO DIRECTLY INFORM HIS
COLLEAGUES IN THAT ORGANIZATION ABOUT THE VIOLENT EVENTS IN HIS COUNTRY.

   IN HIS SPEECH, THE ARGENTINE DELEGATE REPUDIATE THE CRIMINAL ATTACKS THAT
ARE MEANT TO THREATEN MEMBERS OF THE COLOMBIA'S JUDICIAL BRANCH, ESPECIALLY
THE MURDERS OF CARLOS VALENCIA GARCIA, COLONEL VALDEMAR FRANKLIN QUINTERO,
AND SENATOR AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE LUIS CARLOS GALAN SARMIENTO.

   ACCORDING TO THE TEXT OF THE SPEECH -- RELEASED TONIGHT BY THE FOREIGN
MINISTRY IN BUENOS AIRES -- THE ARGENTINE REPRESENTATIVES CONDEMNED "THOSE
TERRORIST ACTIONS THAT, IN ATTACKING DEMOCRACY AND THE STATE OF LAW, VIOLATE
THE PRINCIPLES AND OBJECTIVES OF THE OAS CHARTER AND ALL OTHER INSTRUMENTS
OF THE SYSTEM ORGANIZED TO DEFEND AND STRENGTHEN THOSE PRINCIPLES."

   IN EXPRESSING THEIR SOLIDARITY WITH THE PEOPLE AND GOVERNMENT OF COLOMBIA
AGAINST WHAT THEY CALLED "THIS TRAGIC SITUATION," THE ARGENTINE DELEGATES
STATED THAT THE PROBLEM AFFECTING COLOMBIA "IS A PROBLEM FOR THE WHOLE
CONTINENT, BECAUSE, AS IT HAS BEEN CORRECTLY STATED, THE WORLD OF DRUG
TRAFFICKING HAS NO BORDERS OR FRONTIERS."

   THE ARGENTINE DELEGATION ALSO STATED THAT THE SOLIDARITY OF THE OAS
MEMBERS MUST BE EXPRESSED THROUGH "A CONDEMNATION OF ALL TYPES OF VIOLENCE
AND OF ALL CRIMINAL TERRORISM."

   IT MUST ALSO BE EXPRESSED THROUGH "THE ACTIONS INTENDED TO VIGOROUSLY
DEFEND REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY, OF WHICH COLOMBIA IS A CLEAR EXAMPLE, THE
ESSENTIAL RIGHTS OF MAN, AND SOCIAL JUSTICE IN THE CONTINENT."

   THE OAS RESOLUTION ALSO REITERATES THE MEMBER COUNTRIES' CONDEMNATION OF
ALL ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THE CONSUMPTION, PRODUCTION, AND TRAFFICKING OF
DRUGS AND PSYCHOTROPIC SUBSTANCES.

   IT ALSO REAFFIRMS THE COMMITMENT TO STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUGS WITHIN THE
FRAMEWORK OF THE RIO DE JANEIRO PROGRAM FOR INTER-AMERICAN ACTION AND THE
GUATEMALA DECLARATION (ALLIANCE OF THE AMERICAS AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING).

   THE AMBASSADORS TO THE OAS ALSO REAFFIRMED THEIR INTENTION "TO INTENSIFY
THE PREPARATION FOR THE MEETING OF MINISTERS FROM ALL MEMBER COUNTRIES, WITH
THE GOAL OF REEVALUATING THE CURRENT STATE OF THE DRUG PROBLEM AND ADOPTING
CONCRETE MEASURES TO ERADICATE THIS PROBLEM ONCE AND FOR ALL."

   BOGOTA, 23 AUG 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [REPORT] [ANA
SOFIA GIRALDO] [TEXT] FORMER GOVERNMENT MINISTER CESAR GAVIRIA
TRUJILLO WAS UNANIMOUSLY PROCLAIMED TODAY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE FOR
THE NEW LIBERALISM [MOVEMENT WITHIN THE LIBERAL PARTY].

   GAVIRIA, WHO BECAME ONE OF THE MAJOR CONTENDERS FOR THE PRESIDENCY
OVERNIGHT, SPOKE TODAY.

   GAVIRIA EXPERIENCED ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MOMENTS OF HIS POLITICAL
CAREER WHEN HE WAS NOMINATED CANDIDATE OF THE NEW LIBERALISM MOVEMENT.  IT
IS ALSO PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT TIMES IN HIS PERSONAL LIFE BECAUSE
HE RECEIVED THE BANNERS OF LUIS CARLOS GALAN, WHO WAS KILLED LAST FRIDAY.
HE SAID THE DEATH OF THE LEADER CANNOT BE USED TO ELIMINATE THE SYSTEM OF
CONSULTING WITH THE PEOPLE, WHICH WAS HIS GREATEST POLITICAL ACHIEVEMENT.
HE SAID FORMER PRESIDENT JULIO CESAR TURBAY AYALA IS WILLING TO ISSUE
SPECIAL A RESOLUTION TO ALLOW THE REGISTRATION OF THE NEW CANDIDACY.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [GAVIRIA] IF YOU ALL SUPPORT ME IN THIS EFFORT, IN THE
MIDST OF THIS GREAT RESPONSIBILITY, IN THE MIDST OF THE CRISIS IN OUR
INSTITUTION THAT IS ENDANGERING OUR DEMOCRACY, I AM SURE JUST AS YOU ARE
THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL.  I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT THE ELECTIONS,
BUT I AM TALKING ABOUT MAKING COLOMBIA SUCCESSFUL.  LUIS CARLOS GALAN WILL
GUIDE US FROM HEAVEN SO THAT WE CAN MAKE COLOMBIA BETTER. [END RECORDING] 

   HE SAID THAT EVEN THOUGH HE IS AFRAID HE WILL STILL GO OUT TO PUBLIC
PLACES TO FIGHT TERRORISM.  HE SAID HE IS WILLING TO RESPECT THE RULES OF
THE GAME OF THE NEW LIBERALISM.  GAVIRIA WILL NOW HAVE FULL AUTHORITY TO
APPOINT MEMBERS OF HIS CAMPAIGN.

   EVEN THOUGH IT WAS NOT EASY FOR SOME OF GALAN'S FRIENDS TO ACCEPT THE NEW
LEADER OF THEIR MOVEMENT, THEY KNOW THAT GALAN IS NO LONGER HERE, AND
GAVIRIA IS THE NEW LEADER.

DEV-MUC3-0374 (BBN)

   BOGOTA, 24 AUG 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [TEXT] AS A
RESULT OF COLOMBIAN PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL LUIS CARLOS GALAN'S MURDER,
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES' SECURITY IN PUBLIC APPEARANCES HAS BECOME A
MAJOR ISSUE.

   FOLLOWING ARE THE MINIMUM SECURITY MEASURES THAT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES
MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND SAVE THEIR LIVES WHEN
ENDANGERED.

   FROM NOW ON SUPPORTERS OF ANY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE MUST UNDERSTAND THAT
THEY WILL HAVE TO ABIDE BY THE FOLLOWING SECURITY MEASURES DURING THEIR
CANDIDATES' PUBLIC APPEARANCES.

   MEASURES FOR CANDIDATES 

   1. ALL CANDIDATES WILL HAVE TO PLACE THEMSELVES IN THE HANDS OF
THEIR GUARDIAN ANGELS, IN OTHER WORDS TO THEIR CHIEF ESCORT.  THE
CHIEF ESCORT AND THE CANDIDATE WILL JOINTLY PLAN EACH TOUR AND WILL
PROGRAM ALL MOVEMENTS IN DETAIL AND FOLLOW THE PROGRAM TO THE LETTER.

   THE CANDIDATE MUST INFORM THE CHIEF ESCORT OF HIS AGENDA AND OF ANY
THREAT OR INDICATION OF DANGER HE RECEIVES.  THE CANDIDATE MUST USE HIS
ESCORTS EXCLUSIVELY FOR HIS PROTECTION AND FOR NO OTHER USE.

   2. A CANDIDATE'S ESCORTS MUST KNOW THE CANDIDATE'S BLOODTYPE, HIS
ILLNESSES, AND WHICH MEDICINE HE TAKES.  THE ESCORTS MUST ALSO KNOW THE
NAMES OF THE CANDIDATE'S CLOSEST FRIENDS.

   3. THE CANDIDATE MUST LEARN WHAT TO DO IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION.  HIS
ESCORTS WILL TEACH HIM WHAT TO DO.

   4. NO ONE SHOULD BE SURPRISED IF THE CANDIDATES CHANGE THEIR PLANS AT THE
LAST MINUTE.  THE CANDIDATE MUST NOT FALL INTO A ROUTINE.  HE MUST CHANGE
ROUTES, SCHEDULES, AND PROGRAMS ALWAYS IN CONSULTATION WITH HIS CHIEF ESCORT.

   5. THE CANDIDATE MUST ALWAYS HAVE A DOCTOR IN HIS GROUP.  

   6. EACH CANDIDATE WILL HAVE TO BEAR AN EXTRA BURDEN.  HE WILL HAVE
TO WEAR A HEAVY AND SUFFOCATING BULLET-PROOF VEST.  SUPPORTERS, PLEASE
TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT.

   7. A PUBLIC RALLY IN AN OPEN PLACE AT NIGHT CAN BE DEADLY FOR YOUR
CANDIDATE.  PLEASE EXCLUDE ANY SUCH RALLIES FROM YOUR PLANS.

   8. SAY NO TO THE USE OF FIRECRACKERS AND POWDER KEGS DURING
DEMONSTRATIONS.  SUCH THINGS CONFUSE ESCORTS AND SECURITY CORPS.

   9. SUPPORTERS, PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT CROWDS WHO WANT TO SHAKE
CANDIDATES' HANDS OR TOUCH THEM CAN BE DEADLY.  ESCORTS SHOULD NOT ALLOW
SUCH THINGS.

   10. CANDIDATES WILL HAVE TO LIMIT THEIR WALKS IN PUBLIC PLACES AND REDUCE
THEIR SOCIAL ACTIVITIES TO THE MINIMUM.  CANDIDATES WILL VISIT THEIR FRIENDS
AT UNUSUAL HOURS.

   THIS IS HOW SECURITY WILL BE HANDLED FROM NOW ON.  ALL THESE MEASURES
HAVE TURNED CANDIDATES INTO MEN WITH LIMITATIONS.  THEIR SUPPORTERS MUST
UNDERSTAND THEIR CANDIDATES' SITUATION.  CANDIDATES ARE MEN UNDER THE
DICTATORSHIP OF THEIR GUARDIAN ANGELS WHO LOOK AFTER THEIR SAFETY IN TIMES
OF RAGE.

DEV-MUC3-0384 (BBN)

   BRIDGETOWN (BARBADOS), 24 AUG 89 (CANA) -- [TEXT] WASHINGTON,
D.C.--THE BAHAMAS GOVERNMENT IS SUPPORTING COLOMBIA'S FIGHT ON ILLEGAL
DRUG TRAFFICKING. "THERE ARE LESSONS TO BE LEARNED FROM THE RECENT
EVENTS IN COLOMBIA. WE APPLAUD THE COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT FOR THE BOLD
STEPS HE IS TAKING, BUT WE MUST SHOW THE CARTELS THAT HE IS NOT
ALONE," BAHAMAS' FOREIGN MINISTER CHARLES CARTER SAID.

   THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAS STEPPED UP THE FIGHT AGAINST THE TRAFFICKERS
FOLLOWING THE KILLING OF A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. CARTER SAID THAT "ALL OF
US IN THIS HEMISPHERE" MUST SHOW THE DRUG DEALERS THEY ARE "PART OF THE WAR".

   THE BAHAMAS WANTS TO HOST A MEETING THIS YEAR OF LEADERS OF THE
HEMISPHERE TO DEFINE A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY FOR WAGING AN ALL OUT WAR ON
THE PRODUCTION, PROCESSING, SHIPMENT, DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF ILLEGAL DRUGS.
CARTER TOLD CANA THAT RECENT EVENTS IN COLOMBIA DEMONSTRATED THE NEED FOR A
WELL PLANNED, COORDINATED AND IMPLEMENTED PROGRAM WHICH WOULD TACKLE ALL
ASPECTS OF THE DRUG PROBLEM. HE SAID HIS COUNTRY HOPED SUCH A SUMMIT COULD
BE HELD BEFORE THE END OF THIS YEAR.

   THE FOREIGN MINISTER TOLD CANA THAT HIS COUNTRY HAD INDICATED TO THE
UNITED STATES IN JANUARY A WILLINGNESS TO HOST THE SUMMIT BUT, TO DATE,
THERE WAS NO RESPONSE FROM THE UNITED STATES ADMINISTRATION.  "WE DISCUSSED
THE IDEA OF THE SUMMIT AT THE CARICOM (CARIBBEAN COMMUNITY) FOREIGN
MINISTERS MEETING, THE HEADS OF GOVERNMENT MEETING, AT THE ORGANIZATION OF
AMERICAN STATES (OAS) AND WE INFORMED THE UNITED STATES BY DIPLOMATIC NOTE
IN JANUARY OF OUR DESIRE TO HOST THE MEETING BUT SO FAR THE UNITED STATES
HAS NOT RESPONDED. WHETHER WE WOULD ULTIMATELY GO AHEAD WITH IT I'M NOT
SURE," CARTER EXPLAINED.

   CARTER WAS AGAINST USING UNITED STATES TROOPS IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE
CARIBBEAN IN THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUGS, POINT OUT THAT "THE DEMOCRATIC
TRADITIONS IN SOME OF OUR COUNTRIES WOULD BE THREATENED IF WE WERE TO RESORT
TO THE USE OF FORCE." HE SAID ARRANGEMENTS SUCH AS ONE BETWEEN HIS COUNTRY
AND THE UNITED STATES FOR JOINT POLICING COULD EXTENDED TO INVOLVE OTHER
COUNTRIES IN THE HEMISPHERE.

   THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THAT THREE QUARTERS OF THE DRUGS PRODUCED ARE
CONSUMED IN NORTH AMERICA. "WE ARE NOT THE MARKETS.  COUNTRIES LIKE THE
BAHAMAS, JAMAICA, TRINIDAD, CUBA AND BARBADOS ARE ONLY USED BY THE DRUG
LORDS TO REACH THE 3 BILLION DOLLAR UNITED STATES MARKET," HE REMARKED. "WE
AREN'T REALLY THE TARGET AND THEREFORE WE MUST FOCUS ON THE QUESTION OF
DEMAND. AND WE IN CARICOM, AND SPECIFICALLY IN THE BAHAMAS, ARE READY TO BE
PART OF THE SOLUTION TO THE UNITED STATES DRUG PROBLEM."

   CARTER SAID AMONG THE BENEFITS OF SUCH A SUMMIT WOULD BE "A JUDICIAL
ATMOSPHERE" THAT WOULD LET THE DRUG BARONS, DEALERS AND USERS "KNOW THAT
THEY ARE CRIMINALS WHEREVER THEY ARE OR WHEREVER THEY GO."

   HAVANA (CUBA), 22 AUG 89 (INTERNATIONAL SERVICE) -- [COMMENTARY]
[MANOLO ORTEGA] [TEXT] THE FULL SCOPE OF THE WAVE OF VIOLENCE AND
DEATH THAT HAS SWAMPED COLOMBIA OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS IS NOW
BEGINNING TO BE ASSESSED.  LATIN AMERICA AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD
HAVE REMAINED ON THE SIDELINES OF THAT SOUTH AMERICAN COUNTRY'S
DOMESTIC STRIFE, WHERE HUMAN LIFE IS ALMOST WORTHLESS.  VENEZUELAN
PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD WHEN HE TOLD
COLOMBIAN RADIO CARACOL THAT WE MAY NOT BE DOING WHAT WE MUST
CONCERNING CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN COLOMBIA.  CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ IS
CONCERNED THAT SOME NATIONS MAY BE GETTING USED TO LIVNG IN A CLIMATE
OF COLLECTIVE INTIMIDATION.

   DAILY EVENTS OCCUR IN COLOMBIA AMID A CLIMATE OF NATIONAL UNCERTAINTY.
BANDS OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE BUILT AN EMPIRE OF DIRTY MONEY AND
BLOODTHIRSTY MAFIAS IN DEATHLY COMPLICITY WITH THE MILITARY DEPLOYMENT OF
140 PARAMILITARY GROUPS.  YEARS AGO, WHEN THESE GROUPS ANNOUNCED THEIR GUNS
WERE AIMED AT PROGRESSIVE AND LEFTIST PERSONALITIES, THEY OPERATED WITH THE
UNSPOKEN COMPLICITY OF MANY SECTORS, INCLUDING THE GOVERNMENT.  HOWEVER, FOR
SOME TIME NOW, THE MURDER VICTIMS HAVE BEEN LEFTISTS, LIBERALS,
CONSERVATIVES, AND EVEN POLITICALLY INDEPENDENT PERSONS WHO OPPOSE THE CHAOS
CREATED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS, LANDOWNERS, SOME OFFICERS, AND PARAMILITARY
GROUPS.  LUIS CARLOS GALAN, 46, PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL, LIBERAL SENATOR,
LAWYER, AND NEWSMEN IS THE LATEST VICTIM OF THIS DEATHLY SPIRIAL.  HIS
REMAINS [29-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION] LUIS CARLOS GALAN.  DRUG
TRAFFICKERS HAVE SHOWN THEIR HIT LIST IS NEVERENDING.  THEY ALSO BRING TO
THE FORE THE POWER AND SCOPE OF THE DIRTY WAR THESE PEOPLE BEGAN IN THE
COUNTRY AMID THE GOVERNMENT'S INACTION.

   MANY WONDER HOW THE PARAMILITARY TOP COMMAND CAN GO UNPUNISHED,
CONSIDERING THAT ITS CHIEF LEADERS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED, BECAUSE MORE OFTEN
THAN NOT THE KILLERS DO VERY LITTLE TO COVER THEIR TRACKS.  LOOKING AHEAD,
THE COLOMBIAN ELECTORAL PROCESS THAT WILL CONCLUDE IN NEXT YEAR'S ELECTIONS
HAS BEEN DEALT A HEAVY BLOW WITH GALAN'S MURDER.  THE REMAINING PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATES WILL HAVE TO CONDUCT THEIR POLITICAL CAMPAIGN SURROUNDED BY
ARMIES OF BODYGUARDS, AN ARRANGEMENT WIDELY USED IN COLOMBIA BY POLITICIANS,
LABOR LEADERS, JUDGES, ARTISTS, AND MINOR OFFICIALS.  PERPLEXITY OVER WHAT
HAPPENED IN COLOMBIA IS ONE OF THE INITIAL REACTIONS IN LATIN AMERICA.  LUIS
CARLOS GALAN'S MURDER ALSO CALLS FOR CONDEMNATION.  PERHAPS IN THE FUTURE IT
MAY HELP MAKE THE CONTINENT MEDITATE ON WHETHER OR NOT IT IS ADVISABLE TO BE
INDIFFERENT TO THE COLLECTIVE INTIMIDATION THAT PREVAILS IN COLOMBIA.

DEV-MUC3-0407 (LANG SYS INC)

   BOGOTA, 31 AUG 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 2) -- [TEXT] THERE
HAS BEEN ANOTHER ATTACK IN MEDELLIN, THE THIRD IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS.
ACCORDING TO AUTHORITIES, THE TARGET WAS THE PINTUCO PAINT FACTORY
LOCATED IN SAN DIEGO, SOUTHERN MEDELLIN.

   THERE ARE TWO DIFFERING REPORTS ON THE ATTACK.  THE FIRST ONE STATES THAT
A ROCKET WAS LAUNCHED FROM THE MOUNTAINS.  ACCORDING TO WITNESSES, THE
ROCKET HIT A CAR DEALERSHIP BILLBOARD, WHICH DIVERTED THE ROCKET, CAUSING IT
TO HIT THE FACTORY'S OUTER WALL. OTHER REPORTS SAY THAT THE BLAST WAS CAUSED
BY A BOMB SET IN AN ICE CREAM CART LEFT IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING.

   FOUR PEOPLE WERE INJURED IN THE BLAST AND HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO THE
HOSPITAL.  SEVERAL BUILDINGS WERE DAMAGED, AS WERE THE WINDOWS, ROOFS, AND
FACADES OF SEVERAL CAR DEALERSHIPS.  PINTUCO FACTORY FIREMEN ARE NOW
CLEARING UP THE RUBBLE AND BROKEN WINDOWS.  THE POLICE AND THE ARMY ARE
CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS.

DEV-MUC3-0427 (LANG SYS INC)

   SAN SALVADOR, 4 SEP 89 (CANAL SEIS TELEVISION) -- [TEXT] COLONEL
ORLANDO MONTANO, DEPUTY MINISTER OF DEFENSE AND PUBLIC SECURITY, GAVE
ASSURANCES TODAY THAT THE ARMED FORCES WILL ESTABLISH A TRUCE ON 14
AND 15 SEPTEMBER, AS REQUESTED BY THE PERMANENT DIALOGUE COMMITTEE,
AND THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] HAS PLEDGED
TO RESPECT IT.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MONTANO] THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE COMMITTEE'S
PROPOSAL IS A GOOD ONE AND THE ARMED FORCES APPLAUDS IT, AND IS IN A
POSITION TO ACCEPT IT, AS LONG AS THE FMLN ALSO COMPLIES WITH IT. [END
RECORDING]

   SPEAKING AT A NEWS CONFERENCE, COL MONTANO SAID THAT THE MAIMED
FMLN FIGHTERS' PRESENCE AT THE METROPOLITAN CATHEDRAL IS AN INDICATION
THAT FMLN LEADERS ABANDON THEIR FIGHTERS WHEN THEY CEASE TO BE USEFUL.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MONTANO] I BELIEVE THAT IF THE FMLN WANTED TO
SEND THOSE PEOPLE ABROAD, AS THEY HAVE DONE IN THE PAST, THEY COULD
VERY WELL HAVE DONE SO.  THEY HAVE THE FIGHTERS AT THE CATHEDRAL FOR
PROPAGANDA PURPOSES, AND TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS
INHUMANE.  I HAVE EVEN READ AND HEARD STATEMENTS BY FMLN ALLIES WHO
SAY THAT THE SITUATION OF THE MAIMED CANNOT BE NEGOTIATED FOR
HUMANITARIAN REASONS.  HOWEVER, DID THEY DISPLAY HUMANENESS WHEN THEY
BURNED BUSES, LEFT THE PEOPLE WITHOUT ELECTRICITY, OR DESTROYED SO
MANY THINGS THAT BENEFIT THE PUBLIC? [END RECORDING]

   REFERRING TO THE HOMILY DELIVERED YESTERDAY BY MONSIGNOR GREGORIO
ROSA CHAVEZ, AUXILIARY BISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR, WHO ACCUSED THE AIR
FORCE OF BOMBING THE SANTA ELENA CHURCH IN USULUTAN DEPARTMENT, COL
MONTANO SAID THAT SOME LEFTIST CLERGYMEN DISTORT THE FACTS FOR
PROPAGANDA PURPOSES.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MONTANO] WITH THEIR HUMANITARIAN IMAGE, THEY
OFTEN OPPOSE THE SEARCH FOR PEACE, THEY OPPOSE THE COUNTRY'S
DEMOCRATIZATION AND, IN FACT, THEY OFTEN PLAY UP TO THE FMLN.  IN
REALITY THEIR ATTACKS AND DISPARAGING REMARKS ABOUT THE ARMED FORCES
ARE UNFAIR.  THEY BLAME THE ARMY FOR THINGS IT IS NOT GUILTY OF OR
RESPONSIBLE FOR. [END RECORDING]

   TO CONCLUDE, THE MILITARY OFFICER SAID THE ARMY IS CARRYING OUT AN
OPERATION TO ENSURE SAFETY DURING THE INDEPENDENCE FESTIVITIES.

   BOGOTA, 6 SEP 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [TEXT] THIS
STATION HAS JUST CONFIRMED THAT EDUARDO MARTINEZ ROMERO, REPORTED TO
BE THE FINANCIAL WIZARD OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, WAS EXTRADITED TO THE
UNITED STATES TODAY.

   IN A FEW HOURS, AN ATLANTA, GEORGIA COURT WILL RECEIVE MARTINEZ,
WHO HAS BEEN EXTRADITED BY THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT AFTER HE WAS
INDICTED BY THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT ON CHARGES THAT HE LAUNDERED $1.1
BILLION.  INCLUDING MARTINEZ, 15 COLOMBIANS HAVE BEEN EXTRADITED TO
THE UNITED STATES, 14 OF THEM DURING THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT'S TENURE,
WHILE THE EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THE UNITED STATES WAS IN FORCE.

   THE FIRST EXTRADITION WAS EFFECTED ON THE SAME GROUNDS AS THAT
SERVING TO JUSTIFY THIS MEASURE TOWARD MARTINEZ-- MONEY LAUNDERING.
AFTER BOTERO [NOT FURTHER IDENTIFIED], THE MOST FAMOUS CASES
WERE THOSE OF CARLOS LEHDER, WHOSE EXTRADITION WAS ARRANGED FOR IN
LESS THAN 24 HOURS. WHEN THE SUPREME COURT DECLARED THE TREATY
UNENFORCEABLE, EXTRADITIONS WERE SUSPENDED UNTIL TODAY, WHEN A NEW
INSTRUMENT WAS UTILIZED.  THIS INSTRUMENT WAS ANNOUNCED BY PRESIDENT
VIRGILIO BARCO THE SAME NIGHT PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL LUIS CARLOS GALAN
WAS MURDERED.  THIS IS AN ADMINISTRATIVE RECOURSE THAT EMPOWERS THE
PRESIDENT TO MAKE ALL DECISIONS.

DEV-MUC3-0449 (LANG SYS INC)

   BOGOTA, 8 SEP 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA
SAID IN BOGOTA TODAY THAT IT HAS BEEN CONFIRMED THAT IN PANAMA THERE
ARE "PUPPET GOVERNMENTS WHICH ARE CRUDELY DESIGNATED AND THEN
REMOVED."

   GARCIA, WHO MADE A 6-HOUR TECHNICAL STOPOVER IN BOGOTA ON HIS
FLIGHT FROM BELGRADE, WHERE HE ATTENDED THE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT
SUMMIT, VISITED COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO, WITH WHOM HE HAD
LUNCH AND TO WHOM HE EXPRESSED SOLIDARITY IN THE ANTIDRUG STRUGGLE
BEING WAGED IN COLOMBIA.

   ASKED BY REPORTERS, GARCIA SAID HIS AMBASSADOR TO PANAMA HAS BEEN
RECALLED. "THIS DOES NOT MEAN, HOWEVER, THAT RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO
COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN BROKEN."  HE ADVOCATED LATIN AMERICAN "GOVERNMENTS
THAT REPRESENT THEIR PEOPLES' WILLS THROUGH ELECTIONS."

   "WE HAVE CONFIRMED THAT THERE ARE PUPPET GOVERNMENTS IN PANAMA AND
THAT THEY ARE CRUDELY DESIGNATED AND REMOVED.  WE LATIN AMERICANS
CANNOT ACCEPT THIS PROCEDURE," HE ADDED.

   HE ALSO SAID THAT THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT HAS NOT RECOGNIZED THE
NEW PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT, AND POINTED OUT THAT THE ANTIDRUG PLAN
LAUNCHED BY U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH, "ALTHOUGH LATE, SHOULD SUPPORT
THE AFFECTED COUNTRIES MORE STRONGLY."

   GARCIA ALSO URGED A PRESIDENTAL SUMMIT, INCLUDING EUROPEAN
COUNTRIES, "FOR TRUE INTERNATIONAL COORDINATION AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKING."

   WHILE IN BOGOTA, AND SHORTLY BEFORE BOARDING HIS FLIGHT FOR PERU,
GARCIA VISITED EL ESPECTADOR'S OFFICES, WHICH WERE DAMAGED BY A BOMB
ON 2 SEPTEMBER, AND EXPRESSED HIS SYMPATHY TO THE PAPER'S DIRECTORS.

   CLANDESTINE, 13 SEP 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [STATEMENT] [FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] [TEXT] AFTER WE ANNOUNCED THE
IMPLEMENTATION OF A UNILATERAL TRUCE, 3D BRIGADE COMMANDER COLONEL
MAURICIO VARGAS ORDERED THE INCURSION OF THE ARCE BATTALION INTO OUR
TERRITORY IN NORTHERN MORAZAN DEPARTMENT.

   SINCE THE AFTERNOON OF 12 SEPTEMBER, THE AIR FORCE, USING
HELICOPTER GUNSHIPS AND C-47 AIRCRAFT AS WELL AS ARTILLERY, HAS
REPEATEDLY BOMBED AND STRAFED AREAS NEAR PERQUIN, ENDANGERING THE
CIVILIAN POPULATION.

   AT NOON TODAY, 13 SEPTEMBER, THE ARCE BATTALION INDISCRIMINATELY
BOMBED AREAS NEAR PERKIN, WHERE A C-47 AIRCRAFT STRAFED THIS DENSELY
POPULATED AREA.  AS A RESULT OF THIS ACTION, AN ELDERELY MAN NAMED
JULIO RODRIGUEZ WAS KILLED AND SEVERAL HOUSES WERE DAMAGED.

   THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] HOLDS COL
VARGAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE VICTIMS AND DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE AIR
ATTACKS AND THE ACTIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE ARCE BATTALION.

   WE MUST NOTE THAT THESE ACTIONS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION ARE
TAKING PLACE AT A TIME WHEN THE FMLN HAS SHOWN ITS GOODWILL IN VARIOUS
WAYS IN ORDER TO CREATE THE NECESSARY CONDITIONS FOR A SERIOUS AND
RESPONSIBLE DIALOGUE.

DEV-MUC3-0482 (UMASS)

   BOGOTA, 14 SEP 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE PRO-CASTROITE ARMY OF
NATIONAL LIBERATION (ELN) OF COLOMBIA DESTROYED A SECTION OF THE TECA
- VASCONIA OIL PIPELINE IN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE COUNTRY LAST NIGHT,
THE COLOMBIAN OIL ENTERPRISE (ECOPETROL) OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED TODAY.

   THE NEW TERRORIST ACTION WAS STAGED IN PUERTO BOYACA WHERE THE OIL
PIPELINE WAS DESTROYED AND MUCH ELN PROPAGANDA WAS STREWN.

   ECOPETROL STATED THAT THE ATTACK OCCURRED "DESPITE THE SUBVERSIVE
GROUP'S ANNOUNCEMENT THAT IT WILL SUSPEND THIS TYPE OF ACTION TO
FACILITATE THE PUBLIC DEBATE OF OIL POLICY."

   THIS OIL PIPELINE CONNECTS VASCONIA IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE
COUNTRY WITH THE LINE THAT GOES TO BARRANCABERMEJA IN CENTRAL COLOMBIA
WHERE ECOPETROL HAS ITS MAIN REFINERY.

   THE ELN, A GUERRILLA GROUP THAT HAS BEEN WAGING AN ARMED STRUGGLE
FOR 25 YEARS AND IS LED BY FORMER SPANISH PRIEST MANUEL PEREZ, CLAIMS
THAT THE SABOTAGE AGAINST THE HYDROCARBONS AND MINING INDUSTRIES IS A
WAY OF PREVENTING INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES FROM SACKING THE COUNTRY'S
NATURAL RESOURCES.

   SINCE JANUARY 1988 WHEN IT BEGAN ITS ATTACKS ON OIL PIPELINES, THE
ELN HAS CARRIED OUT MORE THAN 130 ATTACKS AGAINST THE TECA - VASCONIA
PIPELINE, THE PACIFIC PIPELINE, AND THE COUNTRY'S MAIN OIL ARTERY, THE
CANO LIMON - COVENAS PIPELINE.

DEV-MUC3-0498 (UMASS)

   MOSCOW (USSR), 20 SEP 89 (TASS) -- [TEXT] THE CENTRAL AMERICAN MASS
MEDIA HAS REGARDED THE INTENTION OF SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI TO CONTINUE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE EXISTING
CONSTITUTION AS A DEVIATION FROM RECENT AGREEMENTS WITH THE REBELS.

   THE INTENTION IS OUTLINED IN A STATEMENT MADE BY THE PRESIDENT IN
REPSONSE TO THE REBEL PROPOSAL TO GIVE UP THE ARMED STRUGGLE AND JOIN
THE POLITICAL LIFE IF THE ARMY CLEANS UP ITS RANKS, IF REPRESSIONS ARE
STOPPED, ELECTIONS TO MUNICIPAL AND LEGISLATIVE BODIES ARE HELD
EARLIER THAN 1991 AND IF THE ELECTION SYSTEM IS REFORMED.

   ACCORDING TO THE SALVADORAN MASS MEDIA, THIS PACKAGE OF PROPOSALS
WILL BE DOMINATE THE FMLN TALKS WITH THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IN
COSTA RICA IN OCTOBER.

   AT THE SAME TIME, THE SALVADORAN POLICE HAVE STAGED ANOTHER ACT OF
VIOLENCE IN SAN SALVADOR.  SPECIAL POLICE UNITS DISPERSED A
DEMONSTRATION ORGANISED BY THE FEDERATION OF SALVADORAN TRADE UNIONS
IN PROTEST AGAINST THE ARREST OF 12 ACTIVISTS OF WORKERS' AND PEASANT
ORGANISATIONS.  ABOUT 100 DEMONSTRATORS SHELTERED IN A CATHEDRAL.
BUT, THE POLICE SMASHED THE CATHEDRAL'S WINDOWS AND SHOT TEAR GAS INTO
THE BUILDING.  POLICEMEN ALSO OPENED FIRE AND ARMY HELICOPTERS CIRCLED
OVER THE CATHEDRAL.

   DESPITE THE FACT THAT MANY PEOPLE INSIDE WERE WOUNDED, THE POLICE
DID NOT ALLOW RED CROSS REPRESENTATIVES TO APPROACH THE CATHEDRAL, AS
DEMONSTRATORS DEMANDED.

   ABOUT 60 DEMONSTRATORS WERE FIRST BRUTALLY BEATEN AND THEN
ARRESTED, THE SAN SALVADORAN MASS MEDIA SAID.

DEV-MUC3-0518 (UMASS)

   GUATEMALA CITY, 24 SEP 89 (TELEONCE TELEVISION) -- [TEXT]
GUATEMALAN FOREIGN MINISTER MARIO PALENCIA WAS ASKED TODAY ABOUT THE
CASE OF THE GUATEMALANS WHO TRAVELLED TO SPAIN.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PALENCIA] I HAVE NO INFORMATION, THEY DID NOT
[WORD INDISTINCT] THE FOREIGN MINISTRY. I HAVE RECEIVED NO OFFICIAL
INFORMATION CONCERNING THOSE PEOPLE.

   [REPORTER] DO YOU HAVE ANY OFFICIAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THE
THREE STUDENTS WHO LEFT FOR PANAMA?

   [PALENCIA] NO, I HAVE NOT BEEN INFORMED ABOUT THEM EITHER.

   [REPORTER] DO YOU BELIEVE THEY LEFT THROUGH THE NORMAL CHANNELS?

   [PALENCIA] THE FOREIGN MINISTRY HAS NOT CARRIED OUT ANY SPECIAL
PROCEDURE. [END RECORDING]

   THE DEPARTURE OF TWO STUDENT LEADERS WHO SAID THEY HAD BEEN
SUBJECTED TO PERSECUTION AND THREATS CAME LESS THAN 2 WEEKS AFTER THE
DEATH OF FOUR UNIVERSITY STUDENTS WHO HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED, AND
COINCIDED WITH THE PRESENCE IN GUATEMALA OF UN OBSERVER PETER
KOOIJMANS, A SPECIALIST IN TORTURE ANALYSIS, WHO MAY REMAIN IN THE
COUNTRY FOR 6 DAYS.

   FOREIGN MINISTER MARIO PALENCIA ADMITTED THAT THE ESCALATION OF
VIOLENCE IN GUATEMALA OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS, RELATED SITUATIONS SUCH
AS THE FLIGHT OF GUATEMALANS TO OTHER COUNTRIES, AND THE
REESTABLISHMENT OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT TRAVEL ADVISORY, HAVE AFFECTED
GUATEMALA'S INTERNATIONAL IMAGE.

   NEVERTHELESS, THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT
LED TO THE ATMOSPHERE OF UNREST IN THE COUNTRY HAVE NORMALIZED
SOMEWHAT.

DEV-MUC3-0523 (UMASS)

   NO CITY (COLOMBIA), 26 SEP 89 -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED] ACCORDING TO
THE PACT SIGNED TODAY, A BILATERAL COMMISSION THAT WILL BE CREATED
SOON WILL DISCUSS THE MANNER IN WHICH THE GUERRILLA GROUP WILL BE
DEMOBILIZED.

   M-19 COMMANDER CARLOS PIZARRO SAID TODAY THAT THE ORGANIZATION,
WHICH HAS A LITTLE MORE THAN 600 MEMBERS, WILL NOT TURN IN ITS WEAPONS
TO THE ARMY, BUT TO AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION, POSSIBLY THE RED
CROSS.

   HOWEVER, WHILE THE M-19 IS CALLING FOR A DIALOGUE WITH THE DRUG
TRAFFICKERS, INTELLIGENCE SERVICES HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT GONZALO
RODRIGUEZ GACHA, ALIAS "EL MEJICANO," HAS BEEN SURROUNDED AND WILL
SOON BE CAPTURED.

   A SPOKESMAN FOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE SECURITY DEPARTMENT, THE
COLOMBIAN INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION, TOLD REUTER: "WE BELIEVE THAT
IMPORTANT ARRESTS WILL BE MADE IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS, ALTHOUGH WE DO
NOT KNOW IF WE WILL CATCH RODRIGUEZ GACHA."

   RODRIGUEZ GACHA AND PABLO ESCOBAR ARE CONSIDERED TO BE THE HEADS OF
THE FEARSOME MEDELLIN CARTEL, AN ORGANIZATION OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS
THAT, ALONG WITH ITS TWIN ORGANIZATION IN CALI, IS ACCUSED OF
SUPPLYING 80 PERCENT OF THE COCAINE THAT IS CONSUMED IN THE UNITED
STATES.

   THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAS OFFERED A REWARD OF 100 MILLION PESOS
($250,000) TO ANY CITIZEN WHO PROVIDES INFORMATION ON THE WHEREABOUTS
OF THE TWO MOST WANTED MEN IN COLOMBIA.

   YESTERDAY, A JUDGE ISSUED A WARRANT FOR THE ARREST OF FREDDY
RODRIGUEZ CELADES, SON OF "EL MEJICANO," FOR THE ILLEGAL POSSESSION OF
WEAPONS.

   IN RECENT STATEMENTS TO THE PRESS, GENERAL MIGUEL GOMEZ PADILLA,
CHIEF OF THE NATIONAL POLICE, SAID THAT BOTH DRUG TRAFFICKERS ARE IN
COLOMBIAN TERRITORY, THUS DENYING REPORTS THAT THEY HAD REPORTEDLY
MOVED THEIR BASES OF OPERATION TO PANAMA OR BRAZIL.

   FINALLY, IN CARTAGENA DE INDIAS, A TOURIST CENTER ON THE CARIBBEAN
COAST, A POWERFUL BOMB EXPLODED IN A HOTEL, KILLING TWO PEOPLE.

   THE ATTACK WAS ATTRIBUTED TO THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS, WITHIN THE
FRAMEWORK OF AN ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE IN WHICH OVER 70 BOMBS HAVE
EXPLODED IN A LITTLE OVER 1 MONTH.

DEV-MUC3-0525 (UMASS)

   NO CITY (COLOMBIA), 27 SEP 89 -- [TEXT] [BARCO] SOME OF THE
ARRESTED PERSONS ARE EXTRADITABLE.  THE PEOPLE HAVE RISEN UP AGAINST
TERRORISM, AND THE TERRORISTS CANNOT HIDE FOREVER.

   THIRD, MUCH INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR COLOMBIA, ITS DEMOCRACY, ITS
PEOPLE, AND ITS GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN MOBILIZED.  COLOMBIA IS NO LONGER
SEEN AS A COUNTRY OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS, SOMETHING IT HAS NEVER BEEN AND
NEVER WILL BE.

   NOW EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THAT WE ARE A COUNTRY OF BRAVE PEOPLE
WHERE THE MAJORITY ARE HONEST AND HARD-WORKING.  THE WORLD HAS
ACKNOWLEDGED AND PRAISED DEMOCRACY IN COLOMBIA, THE VICTIM OF A
PROBLEM IT HAS NOT CREATED.

   FOURTH, INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE CRIMES COMMITTED BY NARCOTERRORISTS
CONTINUE GIVING POSITIVE RESULTS.  MORE THAN 25 BANDS OF ASSASSINS
HAVE BEEN DISMANTLED, AND THEIR MEMBERS HAVE BEEN DISPERSED.  TWO OF
THE PEOPLE WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF LUIS CARLOS GALAN
HAVE CONFESSED TO THE CRIME.  THE DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE
SECURITY HAS IDENTIFIED 110 PERSONS WHO FORM PART OF A NARCOTERRORIST
NETWORK.  THE MOST IMPORTANT ASSASSINATIONS HAVE BEEN CLEARED UP.

   FIFTH, THE AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CHECK THE TERRORISTS'
COUNTEROFFENSIVE, ALTHOUGH IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT THE CRIMINALS ARE
STILL CAPABLE OF CAUSING MUCH DAMAGE.  THIS HAS BEEN MADE EVIDENT BY
THE EXPLOSIVES THEY HAVE PLACED, THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIED AND WHO HAVE
BEEN INJURED, AND THE FIRES THEY HAVE PRODUCED.

   THE AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FRUSTRATE MANY ATTACKS.
CRIMINALS WHO HAVE CARRIED OUT ATTACKS HAVE BEEN CAPTURED.  FOR
EXAMPLE, IN MEDELLIN, 35 CRIMINALS WHO WERE COORDINATING WITH THE
TERRORIST NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY HAVE BEEN CAPTURED.

   SIXTH, DRUG TRAFFICKING CAPABILITIES HAVE DECREASED.  NOW THERE IS
MUCH LESS COCAINE IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN OTHER WORLD MARKETS. IT
IS IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THE FACT THAT IT IS UP TO THE UNITED STATES
AND THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO INCREASE THEIR ACTIVITIES TO DIMINISH
AND CONTROL DRUG CONSUMPTION.  IF THERE WERE NO ADDICTS IN THOSE
COUNTRIES, THERE WOULD BE NO DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   THIS IS NOT THE ONLY RESPONSIBILITY OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES INVOLVED
IN THE WAR AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING.  IF DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE UNABLE
TO USE THEIR MONEY THROUGH INTERNATIONAL BANKS AND INVESTMENT
OPPORTUNITIES THAT OTHER COUNTRIES OFFER, THE INCENTIVES FOR THE
BUSINESS WOULD VANISH.

   IF THE CHEMICAL PRODUCTS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO PROCESS COCAINE DID
NOT ARRIVE IN OUR COUNTRY FROM EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES, THE DRUG
COULD NOT BE PRODUCED.

   IF THE INTERNATIONAL ARMS MARKET WERE UNDER CONTROL, THE TERRORISTS
WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET THE ARMS THEY HAVE USED TO SPILL SO
MUCH BLOOD IN COLOMBIA.  [CONTINUED]

DEV-MUC3-0536 (UMASS)

   BOGOTA, NO DATE (DOMESTIC SPANISH) -- [SPEECH] [BARCO] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] [BARCO] RECENT EXPRESSIONS OF SOLIDARITY AND SUPPORT FOR
COLOMBIA HAVE GREATLY ENCOURAGED US IN THESE TRYING TIMES.  WE ARE NOW
LIVING IN DIFFERENT TIMES, BUT THE SITUATION IS NO LESS CRITICAL THAN
THE ONE THAT LED TO THE EMERGENCE OF THE UNITED NATIONS.

   A NEW WORLD WAR HAS BEEN DECLARED BY AN AGGRESSOR THAT DOES NOT
RESPECT THE TRADITIONAL RULES OF WAR OR NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY.  THE
AGGRESSOR IS A PERNICIOUS INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION THAT HAS
GREAT POWER AND RESOURCES AND THAT IS NOURISHED BY ILLEGAL REVENUES
GENERATED BY DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   AS THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL RECENTLY SAID, AND I QUOTE: THE ILLEGAL
USE OF AND TRAFFICKING IN DRUGS TODAY IS SEEN AS A SOCIAL PLAGUE THAT
AFFECTS BOTH INDUSTRIALIZED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.  ALTHOUGH
EFFORTS TO FIGHT THIS SCOURGE HAVE INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS,
STATISTICS SHOW THAT THE MONETARY VALUE OF DRUG TRAFFICKING IS GREATER
THAN THAT OF THE INTERNATIONAL OIL TRADE AND IS ONLY SURPASSED BY ARMS
TRAFFICKING.  IT IS CERTAINLY WORRISOME TO SEE THAT MANKIND IS SO
DEEPLY INVOLVED IN TRAFFICKING DEGRADATION AND DEATH.  END OF THE
SECRETARY GENERAL'S STATEMENT.

   THE MEMBERS OF THESE CRIMINAL CARTELS WERE BORN IN VARIOUS
COUNTRIES, AND MANY OF THEIR LEADERS ARE BELIEVED TO BE COLOMBIANS.
ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE THAT SOME OF THEM MAY HAVE BEEN BORN IN MY
COUNTRY, I MUST CLARIFY THAT THEY ARE COLOMBIANS IN NAME ONLY.  THEY
ARE REALLY JUST INTERNATIONAL FUGITIVES WHO HAVE NO HOME.  COLOMBIA IS
NOT THEIR HOMELAND! [APPLAUSE]

   I AM ALSO HERE AT THE UNITED NATIONS TO PRESENT TO YOU THE CRUDE
REALITY OF THIS WAR AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING.  COLOMBIA IS ON THE
FRONTLINE OF THIS BATTLE.  FOR US IT IS NOT A WAR OF WORDS.  MANY
COLOMBIANS HAVE DIED BECAUSE OF THEIR FIRM COMMITMENT AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKING.  APPROXIMATELY 1 MONTH AGO, LUIS CARLOS GALAN, ONE OF THE
MOST PRESTIGIOUS POLITICAL LEADERS IN MY COUNTRY, WAS ASSASSINATED.
HIS DEATH HAS CONSOLIDATED EVEN MORE THE NATION'S WILL AND HAS DRAWN
THE WORLD'S ATTENTION TO THE PROBLEM.  HOWEVER, MANY COLOMBIANS HAVE
DIED OVER THE YEARS -- AS HE DID -- AS VICTIM OF DRUG TRAFFICKING.
THAT LONG LIST INCLUDES 12 MAGISTRATES OF THE SUPREME COURT, AN
ATTORNEY GENERAL, AND A JUSTICE MINISTER.  PROMINENT CONGRESSMEN,
JUDGES, MAYORS, JOURNALISTS, THOUSANDS OF SOLDIERS, POLICEMEN, AND
COLOMBIAN CITIZENS HAVE GIVEN THEIR LIVES FOR DEMOCRACY.

   LAST MONTH, AFTER ANNOUNCING EXCEPTIONAL MEASURES AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKING, WHICH WERE DECREED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE STATE OF SIEGE, DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE CONTINUED AND INTENSIFIED
THEIR TERRORIST ACTIONS. [CONTINUED]

DEV-MUC3-0537 (UMASS)

   GUATEMALA CITY, 29 SEP 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] POLICE SOURCES
REPORTED TODAY THAT A SPANIARD, A FRENCHMAN, AND AN ITALIAN, KIDNAPPED
IN TECUN UMAN ON 27 SEPTEMBER, HAVE BEEN RELEASED WITHIN THE PAST FEW
HOURS.

   SPANIARD JOSE MARIA MARTINEZ, FRENCHMAN ROBERTO LISANDY, AND
ITALIAN DINO ROSSY, WHO WERE STAYING AT A TECUN UMAN HOTEL, WERE
KIDNAPPED BY ARMED MEN WHO TOOK THEM TO AN UNKNOWN PLACE.

   AFTER THEY WERE RELEASED, THE THREE EUROPEANS WENT TO THE REGIONAL
POLICE STATION AND GAVE A FULL ACCOUNT OF THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH THE
KIDNAPPERS.

   MARTINEZ TOLD THE POLICE THAT THE KIDNAPPERS HELD THEM IN A DARK
ROOM AND QUESTIONED THEM.

   THE THREE MEN WERE TAKEN TO A MEDICAL CENTER AFTER THEIR RELEASE
AND, ACCORDING TO THE MEDICAL REPORT, SUFFERED NO WOUNDS.

   OFFICIALS REPORTED THAT MARTINEZ AND LISANDY DO BUSINESS IN TECUN
UMAN AND HAVE BEEN LIVING THERE FOR THE PAST 9 MONTHS.  ROSSY WAS
ENJOYING HIS VACATION HERE, WHEN HE WAS KIDNAPPED.

   ACCORDING TO THE POLICE, THE PERSONS WHO KIDNAPPED THE THREE MEN
GOT THEM DRUNK BEFORE RELEASING THEM SO THAT THEY WOULD LOSE TRACK OF
TIME AND BE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY WHERE THEY HAD BEEN HELD CAPTIVE.

DEV-MUC3-0554 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   LA RIOJA, 7 OCT 89 (TELAM) -- [TEXT] TODAY PRESIDENT CARLOS MENEM
SAID THAT HE IS WILLING TO ACCEPT "ALL THE POLITICAL COSTS THAT MAY
EMERGE" FROM THE PRESIDENTIAL PARDON TO MILITARY MEN AND CIVILIANS WHO
VIOLATED HUMAN RIGHTS.  THE PARDON WAS ORDERED WITH THE SIGNING OF
SEVERAL DECREES TODAY.

   MENEM TALKED WITH REPORTERS ABOUT THE PARDON.  HE SAID: "I CANNOT
ESTIMATE WHAT THE POLITICAL COSTS WILL BE.  I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THEY
WILL BE MANY OR NOT BUT I WILL ASSUME MY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE COSTS.
WHAT INTERESTS ME IS MY COUNTRY, MY PEOPLE."

   MENEM ADDED: "ACQUITTAL MEANS PARDON, AND FROM NOW ON ALL THOSE WHO
RECENTLY VIOLATED HUMAN RIGHTS HAVE BEEN PARDONED."

   MENEM SAID THAT IT IS "BASICALLY" IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF US "TO BE
ABLE TO BUILD AN ARGENTINA WHERE IT WILL BE WORTH LIVING."  REGARDING
THOSE PARDONED, MENEM SAID THAT HE WISHED THEM WELL AND THAT "THEY
SHOULD WORK IN PEACE HERE IN ARGENTINA OR ANYWHERE ELSE."

   HE INDICATED THAT HE IS WILLING "WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS TO MEET WITH
THEM" BECAUSE "IF THE PRESIDENT PARDONED THEM IN THE NAME OF WHAT HE
REPRESENTS AND IF IN SOME WAY HE REPRESENTS THE LAW AND A LARGE SECTOR
OF THE COMMUNITY, THEN I AM WILLING TO TALK WITH ANYONE WHO WANTS."
[SENTENCE AS RECEIVED]

   HE DENIED HAVING BEEN PRESSURED TO IMPLEMENT THE PARDON QUICKLY
"EITHER BY THE ARMED FORCES OR CIVILIANS."  HE POINTED OUT THAT "THERE
IS A MAN WHO DID NOT GET THE BENEFIT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL PARDON; HE IS
ADMIRAL ARMANDO LAMBRUSCHINI WHOSE 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER WAS MURDERED
BY A BOMB.  THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT MUST BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION
WHEM MEASURES OF THIS TYPE ARE IMPLEMENTED."

   MENEM CONCLUDED BY SAYING THAT "THIS MEASURE WHICH I TAKE UNDER MY
RESPONSIBILITY HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE JUSTICIALIST PARTY AND OTHER
PARTIES IN ADDITION TO A VERY IMPORTANT SECTOR OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
AND OTHER RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS."

DEV-MUC3-0555 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   BOGOTA, 8 OCT 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] THE MEDELLIN CARTEL BOSSES HAVE
PROPOSED TO THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT A "DEMOBILIZATION PLAN" THAT
WOULD ENTAIL THE END OF DRUG TRAFFICKING ACTIVITIES, THE SURRENDER OF
WEAPONS, AND THE REPATRIATION OF CAPITAL IN EXCHANGE FOR A PARDON. THE
PLAN WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED WITHIN 3 MONTHS AT THE LATEST, ACCORDING TO
INFORMATION PUBLISHED TODAY ON THE ALREADY FAMOUS GOVERNMENT-MAFIA
DIALOGUE BY LA PRENSA.

   THE OPPOSITION NEWSPAPER LA PRENSA, OF BOGOTA, YESTERDAY PUBLISHED
A REPORT ACCORDING TO WHICH SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PRESIDENCY GERMAN
MONTOYA, ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT, HELD PEACE TALKS FOR A
YEAR WITH SPOKESMEN FOR THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS.  THE OFFICIAL HAS DENIED
THIS REPORT AND DESCRIBED IT AS "HARMFUL AND SLANDEROUS."

   ACCORDING TO NEWSPAPER REPORTS, THE CARTEL BOSSES PRESENTED THE
PLAN TO THE PRESIDENCY IN SEPTEMBER 1988 AND THE PRESIDENCY SHOULD
HAVE WORKED ON IT "DIRECTLY AND SECRETLY."

   THE PROPOSAL, WHICH HAD THREE PHASES, WAS FORMULATED AFTER THE
MAFIA BOSSES HAD DECIDED TO ACCEPT PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S PEACE
PLAN (WHICH WAS PROPOSED TO THE COUNTRY ON 1 SEPTEMBER 1988) "WITHOUT
HESITATION."

   ACCORDING TO THE CARTEL PLAN, IN ADDITION TO GRANTING THE PARDON,
THE GOVERNMENT HAD TO LIFT THE STATE OF SIEGE REGULATIONS TO FIGHT
TERRORISM AND DRUG TRAFFICKING AND TO SECURE FROM THE UNITED STATES A
JUDICIAL PARDON FOR COLOMBIANS WANTED BY U.S. FEDERAL COURTS.  THIS
LAST ASPECT WAS THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE IN THE NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS
"BECAUSE THE COLOMBIAN OFFICIALS DID NOT FIND A WAY TO DISCUSS THE
MATTER WITH THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION, WHICH HAS DECIDED TO FIGHT THE
PROBLEM MILITARILY," ACCORDING TO FORMER MINISTER JOAQUIN VALLEJO, WHO
ACTED AS A SPOKESMAN FOR THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN THE TALKS WITH THE
GOVERNMENT.  ACCORDING TO VALLEJO, A TRIPARTITE DIALOGUE BETWEEN
COLOMBIA AND THE UNITED STATES AND THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES (COCAINE
CONSUMERS) ON THE NONEXTRADITION OF COLOMBIANS WAS AN ESSENTIAL
REQUIREMENT FOR MONTOYA TO GO AHEAD WITH THE PACIFICATION CONTACTS.

   THE FORMER MINISTER SAID: "THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT DECLARED WAR ON
DRUG TRAFFICKERS BECAUSE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAD TAKEN THIS MEASURE
FIRST."  HE ADDED: "AFTER THE NUMEROUS MURDERS OF THE RECENT MONTHS,
THE PRESIDENT THOUGHT IT IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP TALKING (WITH THE DRUG
BOSSES)."

   IN ACTIONS THAT OBSERVERS DESCRIBED AS "INEXPLICABLE," ASSASSINS
PAID BY THE COCAINE CARTELS KILLED FIVE COLOMBIAN PERSONALITIES,
INCLUDING PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL LUIS CARLOS GALAN, BETWEEN 27 JUNE AND
18 AUGUST.

   MEANWHILE, THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO TODAY
CONTINUED TO BE SEVERELY CRITICIZED AND ACCUSED OF HANDLING THE
ANTIDRUG STRUGGLE WITH A "DOUBLE STANDARD" AND CONCEALING "MANY
TRUTHS" RELATED TO DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   ALVARO LEYVA, PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL OF THE OPPOSITION SOCIAL
CONSERVATIVE PARTY WHO SECURED THE DOCUMENTS THAT LA PRENSA PUBLISHED,
POINTED OUT: "I WANT THE FULL TRUTH TO BE DISCLOSED
 BECAUSE THE FATE OF THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE IS AT STAKE."

   LEYVA FINALLY SAID: "I WANT TO KNOW ALL.  IT IS A SAD THING DEAD
MEN CANNOT SPEAK, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO ALWAYS THOUGHT THE GOVERNMENT
MEANT BUSINESS, AND WHO THOUGHT THAT IN THIS COUNTRY AUTHORITIES DO
WHAT THEY SAY THEY WILL."

DEV-MUC3-0568 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   BUENOS AIRES, 10 OCT 89 (TELAM) -- [TEXT] ARGENTINE FOREIGN
MINISTER DOMINGO CAVALLO AND HIS PERUVIAN COUNTERPART GUILLERMO LARCO
COX SIGNED THREE INTEGRATION AGREEMENTS TODAY IN TRUJILLO, LIBERTAD
DEPARTMENT.  CAVALLO SAID THAT THE AGREEMENTS "CLEARLY SHOW THE
EFFORTS BEING MADE TOWARD COMMON GOAL" WHICH MEANS "MOVING AHEAD TO
BUILD A GREAT LATIN AMERICAN NATION."

   THE AGREEMENTS, WHICH WERE PREPARED BY THE FOREIGN MINISTRIES OF
THE TWO COUNTRIES, WERE SIGNED TODAY BY THE TWO FOREIGN MINISTERS IN
THE OLD HOUSE THAT BELONGED TO SIMON BOLIVIAR DURING THE TIME HE LIVED
IN TRUJILLO.  THE CEREMONY WAS HELD UNDER STRICT SECURITY MEASURES,
SEEKING TO PREVENT SUBVERSIVE ACTIONS.  SECURITY MEASURES WERE
REINFORCED IN THE LAST FEW HOURS FOLLOWING AN ATTACK EARLY THIS
MORNING 12 BLOCS FROM THE HOTEL WHERE THE DELEGATIONS ARE STAYING.

   THE FIRST AGREEMENT CREATES THE POLITICAL COORDINATION AND
INTEGRATION COMMITTEE.  CAVALLO SAID THAT THIS IS AIMED AT "TAKING
MORE ORDERLY STEPS IN THE EFFORTS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE THROUGHOUT OUR
HISTORY BECAUSE THE ARGENTINE AND PERUVIAN DESIRE FOR INTEGRATION HAS
ROOTS AS OLD AS THE STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE."

   THE SECOND AGREEMENT REFERS TO THE COORDINATION OF EFFORTS FOR THE
PREVENTION AND REPRESSION OF DRUG TRAFFICKING.  CAVALLO SAID: "THIS
PROBLEM IS REACHING TERRIFYING DIMENSIONS BECAUSE ITS ECONOMIC POWER
IS MIXED WITH TERRORIST AND SUBVERSIVE GROUPS.  AS SUCH IT IS BECOMING
A GROWING THREAT TO THE LATIN AMERICAN DEMOCRACIES."

   IN A BRIEF SPEECH CAVALLO ALSO REFERRED TO THE THIRD AGREEMENT TO
PREVENT DOUBLE TAXATION AMONG AIR AND MARITIME ENTERPRISES.  HE SAID:
"INTEGRATION REQUIRES GOOD TRANSPORTATION METHODS WITH WHICH TO BRING
PEOPLE CLOSER TOGETHER" THUS MAKING "PROGRESS THROUGH CONCRETE
MECHANISMS IN THE INTEGRATION PROCESS IN WHICH OUR COUNTRIES ARE
INVOLVED."

   LARCO COX SAID THAT THROUGH THESE AGREEMENTS "ARGENTINE PRESIDENT
CARLOS MENEM HAS CONFIRMED, THROUGH HIS REPRESENTATIVE, HIS POLITICAL
WILL TO AGREE" TO FIND SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS AFFECTING THE REGION
BY SEEKING "NEW ROADS FOR UNDERSTANDING AND TO STRENGTHEN OUR ALREADY
RICH BILATERAL RELATIONS."

   A FEW HOURS BEFORE THIS CEREMONY, WHICH WAS ALSO ATTENDED BY UNDER
SECRETARY JOSE LUIS FERNANDEZ VALONI AND AMBASSADOR JULIAN LICASTRO,
TRUJILLO WAS SHAKEN AT 0400 BY FOUR POWERFUL DYNAMITE EXPLOTIONS (A
FIFTH BOMB DID NOT EXPLODE) WHICH DESTROYED ABOUT HALF DOZEN OFFICES
OF THE NATIONAL HOUSING ENTERPRISE.

   THIS ENTERPRISE, WHICH OPERATES WITH STATE AND PRIVATE CAPITAL, IS
LOCATED IN THE MONSERRATE DISTRICT WHERE THERE IS A HOUSING
DEVELOPMENT FOR POOR PEOPLE.  IT IS LOCATED 1 KM FROM THE PARADE
GROUND, DOWNTOWN TRUJILLO, ACROSS FROM WHICH IS LOCATED THE TURISTA
HOTEL.  THIS IS THE HOTEL WHERE THE FOREIGN MINISTERS OF ARGENTINA,
PERU, COLOMBIA, URUGUAY, BRAZIL, MEXICO AND VENEZUELA ARE STAYING.

   THE EXPLOSIONS DID NOT CAUSE ANY CASUALTIES AND THE POLICE HOLD THE
TUPAC AMARY REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ATTACK.

DEV-MUC3-0573 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   CUCUTA, 13 OCT 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] THE FAMILY OF NORBERTO RODRIGUEZ
RODRIGUEZ, THE BROTHER-IN-LAW OF VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES
PEREZ, SAID TODAY THAT THE PEOPLE WHO KIDNAPPED 72-YEAR-OLD RODRIGUEZ
RODRIGUEZ ARE ASKING FOR $10 MILLION, APPROXIMATELY 4.1 BILLION PESOS,
FOR HIS RELEASE.  INES RODRIGUEZ COLMENARES, DAUGHTER OF THE KIDNAPPED
MAN, TODAY READ A STATEMENT ON THE PRIVATELY OWNED RCN [RADIO CADENA
NACIONAL], THE MAIN RADIO STATION ALONG THE COLOMBIAN - VENEZUELAN
BORDER, IN WHICH THE FAMILY STATES THAT THE SUM REQUESTED IS
"UNIMAGINABLE."

   RODRIGUEZ, FORMER VENEZUELAN CONSUL IN CUCUTA, WAS KIDNAPPED ON 14
JULY BY FOUR PERSONS WHO HAD REMAINED SILENT UNTIL A FEW HOURS AGO.

   IN THEIR STATEMENT, THE RODRIGUEZ FAMILY SAID THAT THE $10 MILLION
RANSOM IS NOT WITHIN THEIR REACH AND ADDED THAT "THE KIDNAPPERS MUST
KNOW WHAT OUR REAL ECONOMIC CAPACITY IS."

   "WE ARE WILLING TO NEGOTIATE OUR FATHER'S RELEASE, BUT WITHIN OUR
MEANS," THE DOCUMENT ADDS.

   THE KIDNAPPERS, BELIEVED TO BE MEMBERS OF THE PRO-CASTRO ARMY OF
NATIONAL LIBERATION (ELN), REPORTEDLY ADVISED THE RODRIGUEZ FAMILY
YESTERDAY OF THEIR DECISION TO NEGOTIATE HIS RELEASE.

   NORBERTO RODRIGUEZ IS THE BROTHER OF BLANCA DE PEREZ, WIFE OF
VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ.

DEV-MUC3-0577 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   LIMA, 15 OCT 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] VICTOR POLAY, THE LEADER OF THE
PERUVIAN TERRORIST TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MRTA) GROUP,
TODAY ADMITTED THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE MRTA WILL PROPOSE HIS RELEASE
IN EXCHANGE FOR THE RELEASE OF TELEVISION IMPRESARIO HECTOR DELGADO
PARKER.  POLAY IS BEING HELD AT A PENITENTIARY IN LIMA.

   THE REMARKS BY POLAY, WHO WAS CAPTURED BY PERUVIAN POLICE IN
FEBRUARY 1989 IN THE CITY OF HUANCAYO, 315 KM EAST OF LIMA, WERE
PUBLISHED TODAY BY THE LIMA DAILY "LA REPUBLICA," WHICH INTERVIEWED
HIM AT HIS CELL IN LIMA'S CANTO GRANDE PENITENTIARY.

   LAST THURDAY [12 OCTOBER], THE WEEKLY "CAMBIO," WHICH IS DESCRIBED
BY POLICE SOURCES AS THE MRTA'S UNOFFICIAL MOUTHPIECE, REPORTED THAT
THE MRTA -- WHICH UPHOLDS THE BELIEFS OF GUERRILLA ERNESTO "CHE"
GUEVARA -- KIDNAPPED IMPRESARIO DELGADO PARKER ON 4 OCTOBER 1989 IN
LIMA, SAYING THAT HE WILL BE TRIED "BY A REVOLUTIONARY COURT."

   DELGADO PARKER WAS AN ADVISER TO PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA AND
IS THE GODFATHER OF ONE OF HIS DAUGHTERS.

   POLAY TOLD "LA REPUBLICA" THAT THE KIDNAPPING OF THE IMPORTANT
PERUVIAN TELEVISION IMPRESARIO IS OF A"POLITICAL" NATURE AND IS
DIFFERENT FROM OTHER KIDNAPPINGS OF OTHER PROMINENT TYCOONS CARRIED
OUT BY THE MRTA PEOPLE TO OBTAIN RANSOM MONEY, AND THAT, THEREFORE,
THE PETITION THAT WILL BE MADE "MUST BE POLITICAL."

   POLAY TOLD "LA REPUBLICA" THAT HE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DELGADO
PARKER'S KIDNAPPING, A BLOODY ACTION IN WHICH THE IMPRESARIO'S DRIVER
WAS KILLED AND THE IMPRESARIO'S BODYGUARD WAS INJURED.  POLAY SAID
THAT HE CANNOT PREDICT THE DECISION THAT THE "REVOLUTIONARY COURT"
WILL MAKE AFTER THE "PEOPLE'S JUDGMENT" TO WHICH THE IMPRESARIO WILL
BE SUBJECTED.

   POLAY, HOWEVER, ADMITTED THE POSSIBILITY OF AN EXCHANGE DEAL
BECAUSE "THE KIDNAPPING IS POLITICAL AND THE PETITION THAT WILL BE
MADE MUST BE POLITICAL."

   THE PUBLICATION OF POLAY'S INTERVIEW TODAY COINCIDES WITH REPORTS
BY LOCAL NEWSPAPERS ON THE CAPTURE OF 12 REGIONAL MRTA LEADERS.  THIS
NEWS WAS ANNOUNCED IN THE CITY OF CAJAMARCA, 870 KM NORTH OF LIMA.

   THE NATIONAL POLICE HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT THE OPERATIONS, LEADING TO
THE CAPTURE OF THE MRTA LEADERS, HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT OVER THE PAST
FEW DAYS, AND THAT ACTIVISTS, WHO WERE OPERTING IN THE DEPARTMENTS OF
CAJAMARCA, LA LIBERTAD, AND ANCASH IN NORTHERN PERU AND WHO WERE
RESPONSIBLE FOR AT LEAST 20 BOMB ATTACKS IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS, HAVE
BEEN DETAINED.

   THE NATIONAL POLICE ADDED THAT FIREARMS, EXPLOSIVES, AND PROPAGANDA
MATERIAL WERE SEIZED FROM THE MRTA LEADERS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 17 OCT 89 (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT] [TEXT] THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF EL
SALVADOR STRONGLY CONDEMNS THE BASE AND COWARDLY MURDER OF MS DOLORES
ISABEL CASANOVA PORRAS, CARRIED OUT THIS MORNING BY FMLN [FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] TERRORISTS IN SANTA TECLA AS THE
INNOCENT VICTIM WAS ON HER WAY TO HER SPORTS EXERCISES.  THIS CRIME,
VICIOUSLY AND COLDLY CARRIED OUT BY THE FMLN, CLEARLY SHOWS THE WORLD
THE FMLN IS AN ORGANIZATION LED AND MADE UP BY INDIVIDUALS FOR WHOM
HUMAN LIFE MEANS NOTHING.

   THIS DESPICABLE CRIME PERPETRATED AGAINST MS CASONOVA PORRAS
CONFIRMS THE FMLN IS IMPLEMENTING A DEATH-LIKE TERRORIST PLAN THAT
INCLUDES THE MURDER OF PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND THEIR RELATIVES, AS THE
PRESIDENT PUBLICLY CHARGED ON 14 OCTOBER.  CONDEMNING THIS NEW CRIME
BY FMLN URBAN CELLS, THE GOVERNMENT ASKS: HOW CAN FMLN LEADERS IN
COSTA RICA TALK OF PEACE AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS WHEN DEFENSELESS
PERSONS ARE BEING RUTHLESSLY AND IRRATIONALLY MURDERED ON ORDERS FROM
THE FMLN?

   THE GOVERNMENT HEREBY CONVEYS ITS DEEP CONDOLENCES AND SOLIDARITY
TO MS CASANOVA PORRAS' FAMILY OVER THIS IRREPARABLE LOSS. MOREOVER, IT
ASKS THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY OF NATIONS AND HUMAN RIGHTS
RAPPORTEUR PROFESSOR PASTOR RIDREJO TO TAKE DUE NOTICE OF THIS
DESPICABLE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION CARRIED OUT BY THE FMLN AT A TIME
WHEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT DELEGATION IS ENGAGED IN A DIALOGUE IN
GOOD FAITH AND WITH THE BEST POLITICAL INTENTIONS TO REACH PEACE,
SOMETHING THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE YEARN FOR.

   THE GOVERNMENT HOLDS THE FMLN RESPONSIBLE FOR JEOPARDIZING THE
DIALOGUE PROCESS TO REACH PEACE, AND HOPES THAT THE FMLN ADOPTS A
RESPONSIBLE STAND AND THAT ITS PEACEFUL WORDS ARE MATCHED BY DEEDS.

DEV-MUC3-0581 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   SAN JOSE, 17 OCT 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] NO CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENT WAS
REACHED AT THE END OF THE SECOND DAY OF THE CURRENT ROUND OF
NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN DELEGATES OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) AND THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.

   THE DELEGATIONS MET IN THE PASTORAL HOUSE OF THE CONGREGATION OF
THE NUNS OF ST CLARE IN MORAVIA, 4 KM FROM SAN JOSE.

   DURING THE DIALOGUE, THE DELEGATES BECAME INVOLVED IN A DISCUSSION
ON IMPLEMENTATION OF A POSSIBLE CEASE-FIRE AND THE FMLN INSISTED THAT
THERE MUST FIRST BE APPROVAL OF A PLAN TO AMEND THE SALVADORAN
CONSTITUTION, THAT THE ARMY BE PURGED, THAT THE REPRESSION END, THAT
MODIFICATIONS TO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM BE STARTED, AND THAT MEASURES BE
ADOPTED TO GUARANTEE THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIZATION.

   FOR THEIR PART, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT DELEGATES INSISTED THAT
THE FMLN MUST DECLARE AN IMMEDIATE HALT TO HOSTILITIES EFFECTIVE 18
OCTOBER.

   THE GOVERNMENT PROPOSAL INDICATED THAT "IT COMMITS ITSELF TO HALT
ALL OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS AND TO OFFER GUARANTEES TO RESPECT THE RIGHTS
OF ALL GUERRILLAS SO THAT THEY CAN JOIN THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL,
SOCIAL, AND ECONOMIC LIFE."

   FMLN COMMANDER JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS SAID: "WE CANNOT ACCEPT THE
GOVERNMENT'S CONDITIONS FOR THE CEASE-FIRE BECAUSE THAT WOULD MEAN A
SURRENDER ON OUR PART."

   FMLN SPOKESMAN MIGUEL SAENZ SAID: "THERE ARE NO AGREEMENTS WITH THE
GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THERE ARE NO CONCRETE REPLIES TO OUR REQUESTS."

   SAENZ SAID: "SINCE THERE IS NO FLEXIBILITY ON THE PART OF THE
GOVERNMENT DELEGATES, THERE ARE NO AGREEMENTS FOR PEACE IN OUR
COUNTRY."

   JUSTICE MINISTER OSCAR ALFREDO SANTAMARIA SAID: "FIRST WE NEED THE
FMLN TO CEASE HOSTILITIES, THEN THE GOVERNMENT WILL GUARANTEE THAT THE
GUERRILLAS CAN RETURN TO THE MAINSTREAM OF SOCIETY.

   SANTAMARIA REITERATED: "WE WANT PEACE, AN END TO THE WAR, AND AN
END TO THE KILLING, THE PAIN, AND THE BITTERNESS OF THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE."

   UN ENVOY ALVARO SOTO AND OAS ENVOY RICARDO GJIVOJE ARE ATTENDING
THE DIALOGUE AS OBSERVERS, AS WELL AS MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ,
AUXILIARY BISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR.

   DURING THE SECOND DAY OF TALKS, THERE WAS FRICTION BETWEEN THE FMLN
AND THE GOVERNMENT WHEN INFORMATION SECRETARY MAURICIO SANDOVAL OPENLY
ACCUSED THE FMLN OF MURDERING ANA ISABEL CASANOVA [NAME AS RECEIVED],
DAUGHTER OF COLONEL OSCAR EDGARDO CASANOVA, DIRECTOR OF THE ARMED
FORCES STUDIES CENTER.

   FMLN COMMANDER "LUISA" MERCEDES DEL CARMEN RETANA IMMEDIATELY
DENIED SANDOVAL'S CHARGE AND SAID: "THE FMLN HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH
THAT MURDER PERPETRATED TODAY IN SAN SALVADOR."

   THE MURDER ALSO PROMPTED ACCUSATIONS IN THE MEETING BY THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES WHO SAID: "THE FMLN IS IN THE
HABIT OF PERPETRATING THIS SORT OF ACTIONS WHEN IMPORTANT MEETINGS ARE
BEING HELD."

   THE FMLN DELEGATES SAID: "THE CHARGE AGAINST THE FMLN IS
GROUNDLESS."

   THIS AFTERNOON, MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ SEEMED VERY SKEPTICAL
ABOUT THE RESULTS OF THE SAN JOSE TALKS, "BECAUSE FOR THE DIALOGUE TO
SUCCEED IT IS NECESSARY AND URGENT THAT THE TWO SIDES, THE GOVERNMENT
AND THE FMLN, YIELD A LITTLE."

   IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE DIALOGUE MAY CONTINUE TOMORROW WHEN THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN ANNOUNCED THEY WILL ISSUE SEPARATE
PRESS RELEASES.

DEV-MUC3-0586 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   BOGOTA, 19 OCT 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [TEXT]
SPECIAL SECURITY MEASURES WERE ADOPTED AT THE CONGRESS TODAY.  ONLY
PARLIAMENTARIANS, JOURNALISTS, AND EMPLOYEES ARE ALLOWED TO ENTER THE
BUILDING.  THE GENERAL PUBLIC HAS BEEN BANNED.  THESE MEASURES WERE
IMPLEMENTED AFTER A PAID ASSASSIN WAS KILLED RIGHT IN BOLIVAR SQUARE
BY A GRENADE HE WAS TRYING TO THROW AT THE CONGRESS BUILDING.

   THE ABORTED ACTION BY THE TERRORIST ON 18 OCTOBER FORCED THE
AUTHORITIES TO REINFORCE SECURITY AT THE CONGRESS. HOWEVER, BOLIVAR
SQUARE WAS POORLY PATROLLED.  SEVERAL ONLOOKERS ARRIVED AT THE SQUARE
EARLY THIS MORNING TO SEE WHERE THE TERRORIST WAS KILLED WHEN THE
GRENADE EXPLODED.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [UNIDENTIFIED SECURITY OFFICER] THOSE WHO CANNOT
SHOW PROPER IDENTITY CARDS WILL NOT BE ADMITTED.

   [REPORTER] DOES THIS INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES AND SENATORS?

   [OFFICER] YES, ANYONE WHO HAS LEGITIMATE BUSINESS HERE AT THE
CONGRESS.  [END RECORDING]

   THE MEASURES CAUSED VARIOUS REACTIONS AND ANGERED SOME CONGRESSMEN.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [REPORTER] WHY WAS THIS SENATOR NOT ADMITTED?

   [OFFICER] BECAUSE HE REFUSED TO BE SEARCHED, AS EVERYBODY MUST BE.

   [UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSMAN] SEARCHING CONGRESSMEN IS NOT VERY NICE,
BUT IT WOULD BE WORSE IF ONE WERE KILLED.  [END RECORDING]

   EMPLOYEES DID NOT ESCAPE THE CHECK EITHER.  THE POLICE EVEN
CORDONED OFF THE OUTSIDE AREAS NEAR WHERE THE COMMISSIONS WORK.

LAUNCHED BY GROUPS THAT DO NOT WANT THE NEGOTIATIONS TO SUCCEED. HE
ALSO SAID THERE ARE ULTRARIGHTIST GROUPS THAT DO NOT SEEK A NEGOTIATED
SETTLEMENT BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THEIR INTERESTS WILL BE HARMED, AND
ADDED THAT THERE ARE GROUPS WITHIN THE ARMED FORCES AND ARENA

DEV-MUC3-0604 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   BOGOTA, 24 OCT 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 2) -- [REPORT]
[PILAR CALDERON] [TEXT] THE GOVERNMENT SAID TODAY THAT IT WILL
CONTINUE TO EXTRADITE COLOMBIAN CITIZENS SOUGHT BY THE UNITED STATES.
THE GOVERNMENT WILL USE ADMINISTRATIVE CHANNELS BECAUSE THERE IS
CURRENTLY NO EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THAT COUNTRY.

   IN A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, THE
EXECUTIVE BRANCH ALSO DENIED ANY POSSIBILITY OF PARTICIPATING IN A
DIALOGUE WITH DRUG TRAFFICKERS.

   THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL'S COMMUNIQUE STATES THAT THE
GOVERNMENT POLICY IS TO STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG-TRAFFICKING GROUPS AND
THEIR CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS.  THE COMMUNIQUE ADDS THAT THE POLICY
ALLOWS NO ROOM FOR TRANSACTIONS, NEGOTIATIONS, OR DIALOGUES.
THEREFORE, THE GOVERNMENT REJECTS ANY PROPOSAL TO MEDIATE WITH DRUG
TRAFFICKERS -- EVEN IF THE PROPOSAL IS DIRECTLY ISSUED BY THE
EXTRADITABLES OR THEIR SPOKESMEN.

   THE COMMUNIQUE STATES THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT
WILL CONTINUE TO ENFORCE LEGISLATIVE DECREE 18-60 OF 1989, WHICH
ALLOWS FOR EXTRADITIONS THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE CHANNELS.  THIS DECREE
WAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED BY THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE.

   THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL JUSTIFIES ITS DECISION BY RECALLING
THE MANY ACTS OF TERRORISM PERPETRATED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS -- 222 IN 2
MONTHS -- AND THE NAMES OF THE VICTIMS.  THE COMMUNIQUE SAYS THAT THE
DRUG TRAFFICKERS ARE NOW TRYING TO DISGUISE THEIR CRIMINAL POSITIONS
BY CLAIMING THAT THEY ADVOCATE PEACE.

   THE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE ENFORCEMENT OR SUSPENSION OF COLOMBIAN
CITIZENS' EXTRADITION WAS THE MAIN TOPIC DISCUSSED TODAY IN JURIDICAL
AND POLITICAL CIRCLES IN OUR COUNTRY AND IN THE UNITED STATES.
JOURNALISTS AND LAWYERS CAREFULLY READ THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE'S
RULING ON THE DECREE ALLOWING FOR EXTRADITIONS THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE
CHANNELS.  EVERYONE WANTED TO KNOW WHY THE EXTRADITABLES SAID, IN A
LETTER ISSUED YESTERDAY, THAT THEY FULLY ABIDED BY THE COURT'S RULING.

   THE COURT RULED THAT, ALTHOUGH THE EXTRADITIONS VIA ADMINISTRATIVE
CHANNELS ARE ALLOWED BY THE CONSTITUTION IN CASES WHERE THERE IS
ALREADY AN INTERNATIONAL TREATY, THE EXTRADITION MUST BE CARRIED OUT
ACCORDING TO THE TREATY.  THE COURT BELIEVES THAT THE RULING IS QUITE
CLEAR.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [GOVERNMENT MINISTER CARLOS LEMOS] THE GOVERNMENT
MUST DECIDE IF THERE IS A TREATY WITH THE UNITED STATES OR NOT BEFORE
IT ENFORCES THE EXTRADITION THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE CHANNELS.  [END
RECORDING]

   NEVERTHELESS, THE COURT'S RULING DOES NOT END THE EXTRADITIONS TO
THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE, EVEN THOUGH THE COURT BELIEVES THAT AN
EXTRADITION TREATY IS STILL IN EFFECT WITH THAT COUNTRY -- THE ONE
SIGNED IN 1888 -- AND THAT IT SHOULD BE ENFORCED INSTEAD OF
 RESORTING TO EXTRADITIONS THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE CHANNELS, THE
GOVERNMENT CLEARLY SAYS THERE IS NO EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THE UNITED
STATES.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [GOVERNMENT MINISTER CARLOS LEMOS] THE 1979 TREATY
HAD BEEN ANNULLED BY THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE, BUT ACCORDING TO
THE STATE COUNCIL, THAT TREATY REPLACED -- SO TO SPEAK -- THE 1933
TREATY SIGNED IN MONTEVIDEO AND THE 1888 TREATY.  THEREFORE, THINGS
ARE NOW THE SAME AS YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE.  [END RECORDING]

   MEANWHILE, THE BODYGUARD OF EL ESPECTADOR'S CHIEF OF DISTRIBUTION
IN MEDELLIN, PEDRO LUIS OSORIO, WAS ASSASSINATED THIS AFTERNOON IN A
DOWNTOWN AREA OF ANTIOQUIA'S CAPITAL.

EXCHANGE OF THE BOCAGRANDE TOURIST AND RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT, A HOTEL,

DEV-MUC3-0625 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   SAN SALVADOR, 31 OCT 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] SALVADORAN PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI TONIGHT CONDEMNED THE "TERRORIST" DYNAMITE ATTACKS
AGAINST A UNION AND A HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATION, WHICH KILLED 9 PEOPLE
AND INJURED 36 AND EXPRESSED HIS CONDOLENCES TO THE VICTIMS'
RELATIVES.

   "I HEREBY EXPRESS MY HEARTFELT CONDOLENCES TO THE MOURNING
FAMILIES.  THESE TERRORIST ACTIONS CANNOT BE JUSTIFIED AT ALL,"
CRISTIANI SAID THROUGH A NATIONAL RADIO AND TELEVISION NETWORK.  HE
WARNED: "WE WILL CONDUCT THE NECESSARY INVESTIGATIONS TO IDENTIFY
THOSE RESPONSIBLE SO THEY CAN BE SEVERELY PUNISHED."

   HE REITERATED, HOWEVER, THAT THE OFFICIAL DIALOGUE COMMISSION WILL
GO TO CARACAS ON 20 NOVEMBER WITH DETERMINATION TO "MAKE THE TALKS
WITH THE GUERRILLAS FRUITFUL AND FIND A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE
ARMED CONFLICT."

   OPPOSITION UNION LEADERS ATTRIBUTED THE DYNAMITE ATTACKS TO
"RECALCITRANT GOVERNMENT AND ARMY SECTORS WHO OPPOSE THE DIALOGUE."

   CRISTIANI, WHO OFFERED PROTECTION TO "THOSE WHO FEEL THREATENED" BY
THESE ATTACKS, SAID THERE ARE GROUPS WHO WANT TO RAISE OBSTACLES IN
THE WAY OF PEACE.  "THESE ACTIONS ARE USELESS.  VIOLENCE AND TERRORISM
LEAD NOWHERE," HE FINALLY SAID.

AT THE FENASTRAS HEADQUARTERS KILLING NINE PEOPLE, INCLUDING THE
WELL-KNOWN UNION LEADER ELIZABETH VELAZQUEZ.

   THIS TERRORIST ATTACK AGAINST FENASTRAS, WHICH REVIVES RECENT
HISTORY IN THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRY, PROVES THE CRIMINAL NATURE OF THE
ULTRARIGHT-WING FORCES SERVING IMPERIALIST INTERESTS, AND REVEALS
THEIR TRUE INTENTIONS, DESPITE THEIR HYPOCRITICAL STATEMENTS ABOUT
DESIRING PEACE, FREEDOM, AND DEMOCRACY, THE DOCUMENT STATES.

   THE COMMUNIQUE ADDS THAT THIS AND OTHER CRIMES OBLIGE THE

OCTOBER GUERRILLA ATTACK ON THE ARMY'S GENERAL STAFF HEADQUARTERS.

DEV-MUC3-0635 (GE)

   SAN SALVADOR, 2 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE GUERRILLAS'
ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY THAT THEY DECIDED TO SUSPEND THEIR DIALOGUE WITH
THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT CAUSED GREAT SURPRISE AMONG VARIOUS CIRCLES
IN THE COUNTRY THAT VOWED TO MAKE NEW EFFORTS TO REESTABLISH THEM.

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) SUSPENDED ITS
DIALOGUE WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI TO PROTEST
A DYNAMITE ATTACK ON THE HEADQUARTERS OF A LABOR UNION ON 31 OCTOBER
THAT LEFT 10 DEAD AND 30 INJURED.

   ACCORDING TO THE GUERRILLAS, THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DYNAMITE ATTACK ON THE SALVADORAN WORKERS
NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION (FENASTRAS).

   THE FMLN, IN A COMMUNIQUE SIGNED BY ITS TOP FIVE LEADERS, STATED
THAT "WE MUST NOT ALLOW OUR PRESENCE IN THE DIALOGUE TO BE USED TO
COVER UP THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT MASSACRE."

   IT ALSO DEMANDED THAT THE OAS, UNITED NATIONS, AND THE CHURCH OFFER
GUARANTEES TO EL SALVADOR'S OPPOSITION GROUPS.

   REVEREND EDGAR PALACIOS, COORDINATOR OF THE PERMANENT COMMITTEE FOR
THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE (CPDN), WHICH IS MADE UP OF OVER 60 SOCIAL
ORGANIZATIONS, TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT "WE REGRET THIS KIND OF DECISION
VERY MUCH, BUT WE WILL IMMEDIATELY CONTACT THE GUERRILLAS TO TRY TO
RESUME THE DIALOGUE."

   PALACIOS ADDED THAT "IF THE DOOR OF DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION IS
CLOSED, THE DOOR OF WAR WILL OPEN."

   EDUARDO COLINDRES, LEADER OF THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY, THE
MAIN OPPOSITION PARTY, SAID THAT THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT
AND THE GUERRILLAS "MUST CONTINUE."

   "THE GOVERNMENT OF THE RIGHTIST NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE
(ARENA) MUST INVESTIGATE AND PUNISH THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRIME
COMMITTED AGAINST FENASTRAS; HOWEVER, THE DIALOGUE MUST NOT BE
SUSPENDED," COLINDRES ADDED.

   JUAN JOSE MARTEL, LEADER OF THE SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT
(MPSC), WHICH IS A MEMBER OF THE LEFTIST DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE,
EXPRESSED SURPRISE OVER THE GUERRILLAS' DECISION.

   MARTEL SAID THAT RIGHT-WING SALVADORAN GROUPS ARE TRYING TO
ELIMINATE THE DIALOGUE PROCESS, WHICH SEEKS TO END THE WAR THROUGH
NEGOTIATED POLITICAL MEANS.

   SO FAR, NO GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN HAS REACTED TO THE FMLN'S DECISION
TO SUSPEND THE DIALOGUE THAT BEGAN IN MID-SEPTEMBER AND WOULD HAVE
CONTINUED ON 20 AND 21 NOVEMBER IN CARACAS, VENEZUELA.

   PALACIOS, ALONG WITH OTHER RELIGIOUS, POLITICAL, AND LABOR LEADERS,
HEADED A MARCH TO ACCOMPANY THE BODIES OF 10 WORKERS WHO WERE KILLED
DURING THE DYNAMITE ATTACK ON THE FENASTRAS HEADQUARTERS IN DOWNTOWN
SAN SALVADOR, ONLY 200 METERS FROM A NATIONAL POLICE GARRISON.

   THE UNION MEMBERS' BODIES, INCLUDING THAT OF FENASTRAS LEADER FEBE
ELIZABETH VELASQUEZ, WERE ACCOMPANIED BY SEVERAL THOUSAND WORKERS WHO
SHOUTED ANTIGOVERNMENT SLOGANS AND CARRIED RED FLOWERS.

   TENSION WAS HIGH DURING THE MARCH, MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE HEAVY
MILITARY PRESENCE IN SAN SALVADOR'S MAIN STREETS AND BECAUSE THE
UNION MEMBERS DETAINED AT LEAST 30 PLAINCLOTHES POLICEMEN WHO,
ACCORDING TO THE UNIONISTS, INFILTRATED THE DEMONSTRATION.

   THE MARCH ENDED AT THE GENERAL CEMETERY WHERE THE BODIES OF THE
UNION MEMBERS WERE BURIED.

   SAN JOSE (COSTA RICA), 3 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] VENEZUELAN
PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ AND COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS
ARE WORKING HARD SO THAT THE BREAK IN THE TALKS BETWEEN THE GUERILLAS
AND THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WILL BE ONLY TEMPORARY.

   ARIAS TODAY IN SAN JOSE ANNOUNCED THAT ON 6 NOVEMBER HE WILL MEET
IN SAN JOSE WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SALVADORAN REBELS, ADDING THAT
HE HAD TALKED WITH PRESIDENT PEREZ REGARDING THE NEED TO "CALL ON THE
PARTIES INVOLVED TO MAINTAIN THEIR WILLINGNESS TO TALK."

   THE COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT, WHO DID NOT DISCLOSE THE TIME AND PLACE
OF HIS MEETING WITH THE REBELS,, SAID THAT HIS GOAL IS TO "URGE THEM
TO PROMISE THAT THE SUSPENSION OF THE DIALOGUE WILL ONLY BE
TEMPORARY."

   ARIAS, 1987 NOBEL PEACE PRIZE WINNER FOR HIS PEACEMAKING EFFORTS IN
CENTRAL AMERICA, ADMITTED, HOWEVER, THAT "PERHAPS THIS IS NOT THE BEST
TIME FOR THE TALKS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) TO BE RESUMED."

   IN THE PAST 8 DAYS IN EL SALVADOR, THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL ATTACKS
ON MILITARY INSTALLATIONS AND LABOR UNION HEADQUARTERS, DURING WHICH
10 PERSONS WERE KILLED AND MANY INJURED.

   THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS DECIDED TO SUSPEND THE TALKS WITH THE
GOVERNMENT -- THE FIRST ROUND OF TALKS HELD IN MEXICO CITY IN
SEPTEMBER AND THE SECOND ROUND IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA, IN OCTOBER --
FOLLOWING THE 31 OCTOBER ATTACK ON A LABOR UNION HEADQUARTERS IN SAN
SALVADOR THAT RESULTED IN THE DEATHS OF 10 LABOR LEADERS.

   "I VIEW THIS INTERRUPTION OF THE DIALOGUE WITH GREAT SADDNESS AND
REGRET; HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS ONLY A STUMBLING BLOCK IN A
PEACE PROCESS THAT IS NOT A VERY EASY ONE," THE COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT
SAID.

   PRESIDENT ARIAS SAID THAT HE HAD ASKED HIS VENEZUELAN COLLEAGUE --
WHO WAS TO HAVE HOSTED THE NEXT ROUND OF TALKS BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN -- TO JOIN IN HIS EFFORTS TO URGE THE PARTIES
INVOLVED TO MAINTAIN THEIR WILLINGNESS TO TALK "WHEN THE SITUATION
IMPROVES."

   "ON THE PATH FOR PEACE THERE WILL BE TIMES WHEN STEPS BACKWARDS ARE
TAKEN -- LIKE THE ONE CURRENTLY BEING TAKEN IN EL SALVADOR AND
PREVIOUSLY IN NICARAGUA," PRESIDENT ARIAS SAID IN ALLUSION TO THE
DECISION MADE BY NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA'S GOVERNMENT NOT
TO EXTEND THE CEASE-FIRE WITH THE CONTRAS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 3 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] SALVADORAN PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI TODAY ANNOUNCED THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WILL ATTEND THE
MEETING WITH THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS SCHEDULED FOR 20 NOVEMBER IN
CARACAS, VENEZUELA, DESPITE THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT'S (FMLN) DECISION TO SUSPEND THE DIALOGUE.

   CRISTIANI DISCLOSED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL INVESTIGATE THE
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE ATTACK THAT KILLED 10 TRADE UNION MEMBERS ON 31
OCTOBER, WHICH THE FMLN HAS BLAMED ON ARMY AND GOVERNMENT SECTORS.  ON
THAT DATE, THE FMLN DECIDED TO SUSPEND THE DIALOGUE THAT HAD BEGAN ON
17 OCTOBER IN COSTA RICA.

   HOWEVER, THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT REJECTED "THE IRRESPONSIBLE AND
MALICIOUS ACCUSATIONS MADE BY THE FMLN THAT THE ATTACK HAD BEEN
CARRIED OUT BY THE ARMED FORCES WITH THE AUTHORIZATION OF THE
PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC."

   AFTER SUSPENDING THE DIALOGUE, THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS ASKED THE
UNITED NATIONS, THE OAS, AND THE SALVADORAN CATHOLIC CHURCH "FOR
GUARANTEES FOR OPPOSITION ORGANIZATIONS."

   THE PRESIDENTS OF COSTA RICA AND VENEZUELA, OSCAR ARIAS AND CARLOS
ANDRES PEREZ, RESPECTIVELY, TODAY OFFERED THEIR MEDIATION TO GET THE
DIALOGUE UNDER WAY.

DEV-MUC3-0638 (GE)

   SAN SALVADOR, 4 NOV 89 (RADIO CADENA YSKL) -- [TEXT] VICE PRESIDENT
FRANCISCO MERINO SAYS THAT THE GUERRILLAS ARE HURTING THEMSELVES BY
CARRYING OUT ATTACKS SUCH AS THE ONE PERPETRATED RECENTLY.  HE SAID
THE REBELS ARE ACTING LIKE OSTRICHES BY HIDING THEIR HEADS UNDER THE
SAND.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] LOGICALLY THAT IS NO SOLUTION. THEY MUST
REALIZE THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE REJECTED THEM.  THE PEOPLE CONDEMN ALL OF
THESE ACTIONS.  THE LATEST ATTACKS ARE HURTING THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] ITSELF.  THEY HAVE BEEN ISOLATED
INTERNATIONALLY, THE PEOPLE HAVE REJECTED THEM, AND THE GOVERNMENT AND
THE ARMY ARE FULFULLING THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE.  THEREFORE, THEY
MUST CONTINUE WITH THE TALKS AND PARTICIPATE IN THEM SERIOUSLY BY
REACHING AGREEMENTS THAT CAN BRING PEACE TO ALL. THE TERRORIST
AGGRESSION MAKES NO SENSE.

   [REPORTER] WHAT IS THE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION?  WILL IT CONTINUE
WITH THE TALKS?  WILL IT GO TO THE TALKS EVEN IF THE GUERRILLA
COMMANDERS DO NOT ATTEND?

   [MERINO] THE GOVERNMENT DEFINITELY HAS A COMMITMENT TO THE PEOPLE.
IT IS A COMMITMENT THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE.  BESIDES OUR WILLINGNESS
TO ACHIEVE PEACE WE ARE ALSO COMMITTED TO THESE TALKS.  WE WILL
CONTINUE ON THIS ROAD.  IT IS CERTAINLY A DIFFICULT ROAD BUT WE MUST
CONTINUE ON IT.  I BELIEVE THAT THE SAN JOSE MEETING LIKE THE ONE IN
CARACAS, AND MAYBE OTHERS AFTER THAT, HAS BEEN QUITE DIFFICULT.
HOWEVER, WE HAVE DISCUSSED ALL THE PROBLEMS AND THE GUERRILLAS WILL
LOGICALLY REACH THE CONCLUSION THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO SIT DOWN AT THE
TABLE.

   [REPORTER] THEY ASK FOR GUARANTEES FOR LABOR ORGANIZATIONS.

   [MERINO] I BELIEVE WE CANNOT GIVE THEM MORE GUARANTEES THAN THE
ONES WE HAVE ALREADY GIVEN THEM.  THERE IS A GENERAL FEELING THAT
THESE PEOPLE ONLY UNDERSTAND STRONG ACTIONS.  HOWEVER, THE GOVERNMENT
HAS REVIEWED THE SITUATION QUITE WELL, AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO FALL
INTO THAT TRAP OR MAKE THAT MISTAKE.  OTHERWISE, WE WOULD GIVE THEM
THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACCUSE THE GOVERNMENT.  WE WILL LOGICALLY BE
PRUDENT.  [END RECORDING]

   VICE PRESIDENT MERINO SAID THAT DESPITE THE DIFFICULTIES THE
GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE.  THE FMLN
GUERRILLAS WITHDREW FROM THE TALKS AND DEMANDED SECURITY FOR LABOR
UNION ORGANIZATIONS FOLLOWING THE ATTACK AGAINST FENASTRAS
[SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION], IN WHICH 10 LABOR
UNION MEMBERS WERE KILLED, INCLUDING OPPOSITION LEADER ELIZABETH
VELAZQUEZ.

   NEXT WEEK, GUERRILLA LEADERS WILL MEET IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA WITH
PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS TO SEEK SOLUTIONS TO THE COMPLEX SITUATION IN EL
SALVADOR.

   SAN SALVADOR, 3 NOV 89 (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [COMMUNIQUE] [EL
SALVADOR GOVERNMENT] [TEXT] CONCERNING THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] COMMUNIQUE, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT
HEREBY ANNOUNCES THE FOLLOWING:

   1.  ON THE DAY OF THE TERRORIST ATTACK AGAINST FENASTRAS
[SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION], THE GOVERNMENT
STRONGLY CONDEMNED THE ATTACK AND ANNOUNCED ITS PLANS TO CARRY OUT A
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION.  HOWEVER, IT IS REGRETTABLE THAT FENASTRAS
LEADERS HAVE BEEN HINDERING THE INVESTIGATIONS THAT COULD CLEAR UP THE
ATTACK.

   NONETHELESS, THE GOVERNMENT REITERATES ITS DETERMINATION TO CARRY
OUT A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION, AND WILL EVEN BRING TO THE COUNTRY SOME
EXPERTS IN THIS FIELD SO THAT WITH THE HELP OF MODERN SCIENCE AND
TECHNOLOGY THEY WILL HELP THE INVESTIGATIVE COMMITTEE CLARIFY THIS
BLOODY AND CRIMINAL ATTACK AND ESTABLISH WHO IS RESPONSIBLE.

   LIKEWISE, THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO APPOINT A COMMISSION THAT
WILL GUARANTEE THE INVESTIGATIONS, AND IT WILL INVITE THE FOLLOWING:
ONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE UNITED NATIONS; ONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM
THE OAS; ONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE SALVADORAN BISHOPS' CONFERENCE;
ONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE POLITICAL PARTIES; TWO LABOR UNION
REPRESENTATIVES, ONE OF THEM BEING FROM FENASTRAS; DR IGNACIO
ELLACURIA [JESUIT PRIEST AND RECTOR OF THE JOSE SIMEON CANAS CENTRAL
AMERICAN UNIVERSITY]; THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE REPUBLIC; AND THE
MINISTER OF JUSTICE.

   2.  THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC HAS SUPPLIED EVIDENCE FROM THE
BEGINNING THAT IT IS SINCERELY SEEKING PEACE.  THE DIALOGUE COMMISSION
ATTENDED A FIRST MEETING WITH THE FMLN IN MEXICO, AND ACCEPTED A
COMMITMENT, AS FOLLOWS, AND I QUOTE: BOTH PARTIES COMMIT THEMSELVES
NOT TO WITHDRAW UNILATERALLY FROM THE DIALOGUE.

   THE FMLN'S WITHDRAWAL FROM THE DIALOGUE IS NOT ONLY A VIOLATION OF
THE MEXICO AGREEMENT, BUT ALSO [WORD INDISTINCT] THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE'S HOPES FOR PEACE.  FAR FROM SUSPENDING THE DIALOGUE, THE FMLN
SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THE SEARCH FOR PEACE IS NOW MORE NECESSARY THAN
EVER IN ORDER TO HALT THE BLOODSHED.

   3.  EVIDENTLY, IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS ONE, THE ENEMIES OF PEACE
ARE TRYING TO MAKE THE DIALOGUE FAIL.  THE RECENT TERRORIST ACTIONS
ARE AN INSULT TO THE CIVILIZED MECHANISMS THAT HAVE COME UP AT THE
NEGOTIATIONS TABLE.

   THE GOVERNMENT HEREBY NOTIFIES THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT THE DIALOGUE COMMISSION WILL CONTINUE TO
DO ITS WORK, AND IT WILL NOT WITHDRAW FROM THE TALKS IN SPITE OF THE
SORROWFUL EVENTS THAT HAVE BROUGHT MORE MOURNING TO THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE IN RECENT DAYS.

   4.  IN THESE DIFFICULT MOMENTS THAT OUR COUNTRY IS EXPERIENCING,
THE GOVERNMENT REITERATES ITS CALL FOR THE PEOPLE TO REMAIN CALM, SO
THAT IN A PRUDENT AND UNDERSTANDING MANNER WE WILL JOIN EFFORTS TO
HELP REACH PEACE AND NOT PROMOTE VIOLENCE, WHICH ONLY SERVES TO
 HINDER THE DIALOGUE.

DEV-MUC3-0640 (GE)

   CLANDESTINE, 4 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN, COMMANDER SALVADOR
SANCHEZ, ALIAS COMMANDER LEONEL GONZALEZ, MEMBER OF THE FMLN GENERAL
COMMAND, BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [REPORTER] COMMANDER LEONEL
GONZALEZ, ON FRIDAY NIGHT MR ALFREDO CRISTIANI ANNOUNCED SOME MEASURES
WHICH THE GOVERNMENT WILL ADOPT IN CONNECTION WITH FENASTRAS
[SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION] AND THE DIALOGUE.  THE
FMLN ANNOUNCED IT HAD SUSPENDED ITS TRIP TO CARACAS, BUT CRISTIANI
SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION WILL GO TO CARACAS REGARDLESS OF
OUR DECISION.  WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION?

   [GONZALEZ] IN MY OPINION, TWO POSITIONS ON THE DIALOGUE AND THE
NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS WERE MADE EVIDENT IN SAN JOSE.  THE GOVERNMENT OF
ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND VIEW THE DIALOGUE
AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR TALKING, BUYING TIME, AND BUILDING A GOOD IMAGE
FOR THEMSELVES.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THE FMLN IS WORKING FOR A REAL
NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS.  THE FMLN HAS OPENED A BROADER DEBATE, A DEBATE
THAT INCLUDES DISCUSSIONS WITH AND THE PARTICIPATION OF POLITICAL
PARTIES, THE SOCIAL FORCES, THE CHURCH, ALL THE SECTORS. WE HAVE
INITIATED A NATIONAL DIALOGUE.  AS WE SEE IT, THE GOAL IS PART OF A
WHOLE, IT IS NOT EVERYTHING.  THE ENTIRE PROCESS OF ALLOWING THE
PARTICIPATION OF THE SOCIAL FORCES IS IMPORTANT ALSO.

   IN RECENT DAYS WE HAVE SEEN ACTIONS UNPRECEDENTED IN THE HISTORY OF
EL SALVADOR.  THERE WAS THE ATTACK ON WORKERS IN WHICH 10 WORKERS DIED
AND 31 WERE INJURED.  THE FMLN CANNOT IGNORE THIS FACT.  THIS IS PART
OF THE PROCESS.  WE HAVE SAID THAT WE ARE GOING TO ESTABLISH CONTACT
WITH OBSERVERS AND MEDIATORS TO ANALYZE THE SITUATION, AND WE WILL
DISCUSS THIS PROCESS WITH THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND THE SOCIAL FORCES.
WHAT WE WANT IS TO CONSOLIDATE THE NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS.  WE ARE NOT
TRYING TO ENHANCE OUR IMAGE; OUR PEOPLE KNOW WHO IS TELLING THE TRUTH.

   IN SAN JOSE WE MADE A SOLUTION PROPOSAL THAT ENVISAGES DEMOCRACY,
HUMAN RIGHTS, AND A PROCESS TO FIND A WAY OUT OF THE SALVADORAN
CONFLICT.  ON MONDAY AND WEDNESDAY OF NEXT WEEK WE ARE GOING TO MEET
IN WASHINGTON WITH OAS AND UN REPRESENTATIVES.  ALSO ON MONDAY IN SAN
JOSE, COSTA RICA, WE COULD BE IN CONTACT WITH THE COSTA RICAN
GOVERNMENT TO ANALYZE THE SITUATION.

   WE WILL ANALYZE DEVELOPMENTS TO DETERMINE THE POSITION OF THE
CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT.  IF ACTIONS BY THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT CLOSE
THE POSSIBILITIES OF CARACAS, THEN WE WILL ADOPT MEASURES.  WHAT WE
HAVE DONE IS TO ANNOUNCE A SUSPENSION TO CREATE CONDITIONS FOR MAKING
PROGRESS TOWARD REAL NEGOTIATIONS, AS THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENTS
ESTABLISH.

   [REPORTER] THEN WHY IS THE GOVERNMENT GOING TO CARACAS, COMMANDER?

   [GONZALEZ] I BELIEVE THAT THE ANNOUNCEMENT ON THE GOVERNMENT
DELEGATION GOING TO CARACAS IS AIMED AT ENHANCING THE GOVERNMENT'S
 IMAGE, AT CREATING A SMOKE SCREEN AROUND THE MASSACRE COMMITTED
AGAINST THE POPULAR MOVEMENT.

   [REPORTER] NOW THAT YOU MENTION THE FENASTRAS MASSACRE, WHAT DO YOU
THINK ABOUT THE CREATION OF A COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE THIS CASE THAT
CRISTIANI HAS ANNOUNCED?

   [GONZALEZ] ONE OF THE POINTS OF OUR SAN JOSE PROPOSAL CALLS FOR
CHANGING THE SALVADORAN LEGAL SYSTEM BECAUSE IT IS VITIATED AND IS IN
THE HANDS OF ONE SINGLE PARTY.  SO, IN THIS FRAMEWORK, CONDUCTING AN
INVESTIGATION IS LIKE PUTTING THE CASE INSIDE A FORGOTTEN DRAWER.
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MONSIGNOR ROMERO CASE, THE CASE OF THE
REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATIC FRONT LEADERS, AND THE CASES OF THOUSANDS OF
WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN MURDERED AND WHOSE CASES HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN.
THE PURPOSE OF THIS COMMISSION IS TO CREATE A SMOKE SCREEN AROUND THE
GRAVE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS BEING COMMITTED BY THE CRISTIANI
GOVERNMENT.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE PERSONS WHO HAVE BEEN INVITED TO FORM
PART OF THIS COMMISSION SHOULD NOT LEND THEMSELVES TO PLAYING A PART
IN THE EFFORT TO HIDE WHAT IS REALLY BEHIND ALL THIS.  WHAT THE
CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT WANTS IS TO DIVERT AWAY FROM EMILIO PONCE ALL THE
ACCUSATIONS AND CHARGES, AND PONCE IS THE ONE WHO IS DIRECTLY INVOLVED
IN THIS KIND OF ATTACK.  THE STATE POLICY OF THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT
IS REPRESSION, AND THIS STATE POLICY IS BEING IMPLEMENTED BY THE
CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT, CRISTIANI, AND THE HIGH COMMAND, AND THEY ARE
DOING IT THROUGH THE REPRESSIVE BODIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY
FUNCTION AS CIVILIANS, AS DEATH SQUADS, OR IN UNIFORM.  [CONTINUED]

DEV-MUC3-0642 (GE)

   SAN SALVADOR, 5 NOV 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] IT HAS BEEN REPORTED IN THIS
CAPITAL THAT A DELEGATION OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT (FMLN) WILL MEET THIS WEEK IN WASHINGTON WITH UN AND OAS
REPRESENTATIVES TO ANALYZE THE COUNTRY'S SITUATION AND THE FUTURE OF
THE TALKS BETWEEN THE REBELS AND ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S ADMINISTRATION.

   COMMANDER LEONEL GONZALEZ, ONE OF THE FIVE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND
MEMBERS, ISSUED A STATEMENT THROUGH RADIO VENCEREMOS -- THE OFFICIAL
VOICE OF THE GUERRILLA ORGANIZATIONS -- AND SAID THAT THE MEETINGS
WILL START TOMORROW 6 NOVEMBER.

   OTHER FMLN DELEGATES WILL MEET TOMORROW WITH COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT
OSCAR ARIAS, WHO HAS STATED HIS CONCERN REGARDING THE TALKS BETWEEN
THE REBELS AND CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT AFTER RIGHT-WING SQUADS
ASSASSINATED 10 LABOR LEADERS.

   COMMANDER GONZALEZ SAID "THAT THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION'S
DOUBLE-FACED CONDUCT IS PRECLUDING THE POSSIBILITIES FOR ACHIEVING A
PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT."

   "THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION AND THE ARMY OPPOSE REAL
NEGOTIATIONS, AND THEIR CONCEPT OF A DIALOGUE IS TO TALK AND TALK --
BUT ONLY TO GAIN TIME AND PROJECT A GOOD IMAGE AT THE NATIONAL AND
INTERNATIONAL LEVEL," THE REBEL LEADER SAID.

   REFERRING TO THIS, GONZALEZ ASSERTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION
TO SEND ITS DELEGATION TO THE 20-21 NOVEMBER MEETING IN CARACAS,
WHETHER THE GUERRILLA REPRESENTATIVES ATTEND IT OR NOT, IS AIMED AT
"CREATING A SMOKE SCREEN TO COVER THE MASSACRES PERPETRATED THIS WEEK
AGAINST THE PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT."

   COMMANDER GONZALEZ ALSO REFERRED TO CRISTIANI'S ANNOUNCEMENT THAT A
COMMISSION WILL BE CREATED WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF UN AND OAS
DELEGATES TO INVESTIGATE THE 10 LABOR LEADERS' MASSACRE.

   "IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CARRY OUT AN INVESTIGATION WITH A CORRUPT
JUDICIAL SYSTEM LIKE THE ONE IN EL SALVADOR ," GONZALEZ SAID.  HE
RECALLED THAT THE AUTHORITIES HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SOLVE THE MURDER
OF SAN SALVADOR ARCHBISHOP OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO IN 10 YEARS.  THE
GUERRILLA BLAMES MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON, ONE OF THE GOVERNMENT
PARTY'S IDEOLOGISTS, FOR ROMERO'S MURDER.

   THE FMLN COMMANDER ALSO WARNED THAT THE ARMY "HAS LAUNCHED A
CAMPAIGN TO CONFUSE NATIONAL AND WORLD OPINION BY ACCUSING THE
GUERRILLAS OF PERPETRATING TERRORIST ACTIONS."

   THE ARMED FORCES ACTUALLY WANT "TO COVER UP THEIR REPRESSIVE POLICY
BECAUSE THEY HAVE SHIFTED FROM SELECTIVE ARRESTS TO MASS ARRESTS --
AND FROM GENOCIDE TO INDISCRIMINATE ATTACKS," HE ADDED.

   THE GUERRILLA COMMANDER ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT THE GUERRILLA FORCES
WILL MAINTAIN A HIGH LEVEL OF MILITARY ACTIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY
AS LONG AS THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF CONTINUING A REAL DIALOGUE -
NEGOTIATION PROCESS WHICH LEADS THE COUNTRY TO AN EVERLASTING PEACE.

DEV-MUC3-0648 (GE)

   CLANDESTINE, 7 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
VENANCIO SALVATIERRA, WITH NOM DE GUERRE OF MARIO LOPEZ, A COMMANDER
OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN, BY
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [REPORTER] COMMANDER MARIO LOPEZ,
FOLLOWING RECENT INCIDENTS AND TERRORIST ACTIONS SUCH AS THE ATTACK ON
FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION], THE U.S.
OFFICIAL ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INTER-AMERICAN AFFAIRS
BERNARD ARONSON CAME TO OUR COUNTRY.  HE SAID THAT U.S. ASSISTANCE
WILL DEPEND [WORDS INDISTINCT]. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT HIS VISIT TO
OUR COUNTRY?

   [SALVATIERRA] IT IS BASICALLY AIMED AT SAVING CRISTIANI'S PRESTIGE
AND IMAGE, AS THIS HAS BEEN A MATTER OF GREAT CONCERN FOR THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT FROM THE BEGINNING. THEY NEED A POTABLE IMAGE, AN IMAGE
THAT PORTRAYS LEGITIMACY, AND AN IMAGE OF MODERATION THAT WILL NOT
ISOLATE THE GOVERNMENT INTERNATIONALLY. THE FENASTRAS INCIDENT
UNDOUBTEDLY UNMASKED CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT. THEREFORE, ARONSON'S
VISIT IS AIMED AT SAVING CRISTIANI'S IMAGE AND SUPPORTING CRISTIANI'S
INITIATIVE OF CREATING A COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE THOSE INCIDENTS, IN
ORDER TO FOSTER HOPES AND CREDIBILITY AMONG SOME GROUPS REGARDING THE
GOVERNMENT'S INTEREST IN CLARIFYING THE INCIDENTS. THAT WAS ARONSON'S
INTENTION.

   AS A MATTER OF FACT, CRISTIANI'S IMAGE IS IMPORTANT FOR THE AID
ITSELF. ASPECTS RELATED TO HUMAN RIGHTS PLAY A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN
THE DEBATES AT THE U.S. CONGRESS, WHERE THE AID IS APPROVED.
THEREFORE, THAT AID WOULD BE ENDANGERED IF THE DEBATES ON VIOLATIONS
OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN EL SALVADOR ARE INTENSIFIED. IT COULD HAVE AN
EFFECT ON THAT. SO WHAT THEY ARE REALLY TRYING TO SAVE IS THE AID TO
CONTINUE SUPPORTING THE WAR.

   IN THAT REGARD, WE MUST ALSO REMEMBER THAT WITHIN THE DOCTRINE OF
LOW INTENSITY WARFARE, THE POLITICAL ASPECTS OF THE COUNTERINSURGENCY
PLAN PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE [WORDS INDISTINCT] THAT WILL NOT APPEAR TO
BE IN THE EXTREME RIGHT; A GOVERNMENT THAT APPEARS TO BE MORE IN THE
CENTER THAN IN THE EXTREME RIGHT, IN ORDER TO CREATE EXPECTATIONS
WITHIN SOME GROUPS REGARDING THE GOVERNMENT'S CREDIBILITY, AND ALSO AT
THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL. WHILE TRYING TO DEFEAT THE REBELS MILITARILY
AND THROUGH REPRESSION, IT IS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN AN ACCEPTABLE
IMAGE OF THE GOVERNMENT.

   [REPORTER] YOU ARE A MEMBER OF THE FMLN'S POLITICAL-DIPLOMATIC
COMMISSION.  AS A RESULT OF THE FENASTRAS INCIDENTS, OUR FRONT
CANCELLED ITS ATTENDANCE AT THE CARACAS MEETING. WHAT ARE THE
POSSIBILITIES FOR RESTORING THE TALKS AND CONTINUING THE DIALOGUE -
NEGOTIATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT?

   [SALVATIERRA] THE FMLN IS INTERESTED IN A REAL DIALOGUE, A DIALOGUE
THAT WILL LEAD TO A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION OF THE CONFLICT; IN OTHER
WORDS, A DIALOGUE THAT WILL LEAD TO NEGOTIATIONS.  WE DIFFER WITH
CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT ON THIS.  FROM THE BEGINNING, ARENA
[NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] HAS EXPRESSED ITS WILLINGNESS TO
PARTICIPATE IN A DIALOGUE, BUT NOT TO NEGOTIATE.  THEY HAVE A TOTALLY
DIFFERENT CONCEPT.  [CONTINUED]

DEV-MUC3-0659 (GE)

   SAN SALVADOR, 9 NOV 89 (EL DIARIO DE HOY) -- [TEXT] THE GOVERNMENT
OF PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI YESTERDAY REAFFIRMED ITS WILLINGNESS TO
THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATE THE ATTACK AGAINST FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN
WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION].  IT ALSO MADE AN APPEAL SO THAT NO
ACCUSATIONS LACKING SCIENTIFIC SUPPORT ARE MADE IN ORDER NOT TO
GENERATE SPECULATIONS THAT POLITICIZE THIS CASE.

   IN AN OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE, THE GOVERNMENT MADE THE PRECEDING
STATEMENT BECAUSE OF THE "BIASED PROPAGANDISTIC CAMPAIGN BEING
DEVELOPED BY THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] AND
OTHER POLITICAL AND LABOR UNION ORGANIZATIONS, SEEKING TO CREATE A
DISTORTED VIEW OF THE RECENT TERRORIST ATTACKS IN THE COUNTRY."

   THE COMMUNIQUE RECALLS THAT ON THE SAME DAY OF THE TERRORIST ATTACK
AGAINST FENASTRAS, THE GOVERNMENT CONDEMNED SUCH CRIMINAL ACTION.  THE
COMMUNIQUE ALSO EXPRESSES THE GOVERNMENT'S INTENTION TO CONDUCT A
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION WITHIN A FRAMEWORK WORTHY OF CONFIDENCE.  THE
GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO CREATE A COMMISSION THAT WILL BE COMPOSED OF
REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE UNITED NATIONS, THE OAS, CEDES [SALVADORAN
EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE], POLITICAL PARTIES, LABOR UNION ORGANIZATIONS --
INCLUDING ONE FROM FENASTRAS -- DR IGNACIO ELLACURIA, THE PROSECUTING
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, AND THE JUSTICE MINISTER.

   HOWEVER, FENASTRAS LEADERS HAVE CONTINUED HINDERING THE
INVESTIGATION AT THE SITE OF THE INCIDENT, THE COMMUNIQUE ADDS.

   THE GOVERNMENT COMMUNIQUE STATES THAT THE FENASTRAS REFUSAL TO
PARTICIPATE IN THE COMMISSION COULD BE INTERPRETED AS "AN INTENTIONAL
PLAN BY FENASTRAS LEADERS TO PREVENT THE INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS TERRORIST ATTACK."  THEREFORE, THE
GOVERNMENT COMMUNIQUE REQUESTS THE ABANDONMENT OF SUCH AN ATTITUDE.

   THE GOVERNMENT, THE COMMUNIQUE ADDS, BELIEVES THAT THE
INVESTIGATION IS LEGAL AND THAT FENASTRAS HAS THE MORAL DUTY TO HELP
IN THE INVESTIGATION TO CLARIFY THIS CASE.

   THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT CRISTIANI REITERATED ITS APPEAL TO
CITIZENS TO ABSTAIN FROM MAKING ACCUSATIONS LACKING SCIENTIFIC
EVIDENCE, IN ORDER TO PREVENT SPECULATION THAT HAMPERS THE NORMAL
DEVELOPMENT OF THE JUDICIAL PROCESS THAT HAS ALREADY BEGUN.  THE
GOVERNMENT REITERATED THAT "ITS TRUE OBJECTIVE IS TO CLARIFY THIS
BARBARIC ACTION AND TO PUNISH THOSE RESPONSIBLE, NO MATTER WHO THEY
ARE."

   "WE REQUEST ALL CITIZENS TO ABSTAIN FROM ISSUING SPECULATIVE
OPINIONS, AND, SHOULD THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO REPORT THAT WOULD HELP
CLARIFY THIS REGRETTABLE INCIDENT, THEY SHOULD DO IT WITHIN THE
JUDICIAL PROCESS," THE OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT COMMUNIQUE STATES.

   THE GOVERNMENT REAFFIRMED ITS DETERMINATION TO CONTINUE SEARCHING
FOR PEACE THROUGH PEACEFUL MEANS AND DIALOGUE.  ACCORDING TO THE
MEXICO AGREEMENTS, THE FLMN IS ALSO OBLIGED TO CONTINUE WITH THE
DIALOGUE PROCESS AND "CANNOT UNILATERALLY WITHDRAW BECAUSE IT WOULD BE
VIOLATING NOT ONLY THOSE AGREEMENTS, BUT ALSO THE ASPIRATION OF OUR
PEOPLE, WHICH IS TO ATTAIN PEACE," THE COMMUNIQUE SAYS.

DEV-MUC3-0662 (GE)

   CLANDESTINE, 9 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [REPORT] [TEXT] [BEGIN
RECORDING] [HANDAL, MEMBER OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT GENERAL COMMAND] WHAT DOES THIS TELL US?  WHAT MESSAGE DOES THIS
CONVEY?  IT TELLS US THAT THESE ORGANIZATIONS, THE SO-CALLED SUPPORT
ORGANIZATIONS -- THE COPREFA [ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE] CALLS THEM
FRONTS -- ARE COMPONENTS OF THE ENEMY SIDE IN THE WAR.

   WHEN THEY SIT DOWN TO TALK TO THE MAIN REPRESENTATIVES OF THE
ENEMY, THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT], AND WHEN
THEY NEGOTIATE ISSUES LIKE THE END TO HOSTILITIES, THE GOVERNMENT
IMMEDIATELY MAKE DEMANDS AND ALL THESE POLITICAL, IDEOLOGICAL,
PSYCHOLOGICAL, ETCETERA, ETCETERA, ACTIONS STOP.  THE MESSAGE THIS
CONVEYS IS THAT AS FAR AS THE GOVERNMENT IS CONCERNED, ALL THOSE
ORGANIZATIONS ARE PART OF THE ENEMY SIDE IN THE WAR.  WHAT HAPPENED
LATER WAS THE CREATION OF MANY SUCH FRONTS.  THE REPRESSION HAS BEEN
GOING ON FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND HAD INCREASED.  HOWEVER, THE
GOVERNMENT HAD NEVER PRESENTED AN IDEA LIKE THIS ONE.  ONCE IT DID,
EVERYTHING BECAME VERY CLEAR.  ALL THE PAST ACTIONS ARE PART OF THE
GOVERNMENT'S AND THE ARMY'S WAR ACTIONS AGAINST ALL THESE EXPRESSIONS
AND DEMONSTRATIONS BY THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   THE FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION]
MASSACRE WAS PART OF THIS PLAN.  THE KILLING OF 3 MEMBERS OF THE MPSC
[SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT] IN SONSONATE CARRIED OUT BY THE
6TH MILITARY DETACHMENT IN FRONT OF WITNESSES -- THEY LEFT MESSAGES ON
THE BODIES STATING THAT THEY WERE TRAITORS TO THE HOMELAND -- WAS
CARRIED OUT WITH THE CLEAR INTENTION OF SENDING ANOTHER MESSAGE.  THE
MESSAGE IS: NOT ONLY IN THEORY DO WE CONSIDER YOU COMPONENTS OF THE
ENEMY SIDE.  YOU ARE THE ENEMY AND THAT IS WHY WE ARE KILLING YOU.
[END RECORDING]

   REGARDING THE VISIT TO EL SALVADOR OF BERNARD ARONSON, ASSISTANT
SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INTER-AMERICAN AFFAIRS, COMMANDER JORGE SHAFIK
HANDAL SAID:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [HANDAL] THE HEADS OF THE ARMED FORCES AND
MILITARY UNITS WHO CARRIED OUT THESE CRIMES REMAIN IN OFFICE.  THOSE
WHO GAVE THE ORDERS REMAIN IN OFFICE.  THEN HOW CAN AN INVESTIGATION
BE CARRIED OUT?  A CHAIN OF COMMAND MUST BE FOLLOWED IN THE MILITARY.
IF A SUBORDINATE IS GOING TO BE INTERROGATED, ONE MUST FIRST ASK
PERMISSION FROM HIS SUPERIOR, AND THEY ARE THE SUPERIORS.  BESIDES, NO
ONE KNOWS WHO THE SUBORDINATES WHO PARTICIPATED ARE.  THAT INFORMATION
MUST COME FROM THE ARMY.  THAT IS WHY WE HAVE SAID THAT THE LEAST THEY
CAN DO BEFORE THEY BEGIN INVESTIGATING THIS INCIDENT IS REMOVE COLONEL
RENE EMILIO PONCE.  THAT WOULD BE THE RIGHT THING TO DO.  I WOULD EVEN
ADD THAT THERE ARE A FEW OTHERS WHO SHOULD BE REMOVED.

   IF WE WERE LIVING IN A COUNTRY WITH A DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL SYSTEM
AND WITH LABOR UNIONS, THAT WOULD BE COMMON PRACTICE.  IT WOULD NOT
EVEN BE NECESSARY TO BRING THIS UP AT A PUBLIC DEBATE.  THE FIRST
THING THE PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE DONE AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE
ARMED FORCES -- HE IS INVOLVED IN THESE CRIMES BECAUSE HE IS COMMANDER
IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES -- IS REMOVE THEM AND NOT SAY THAT HE WAS
NOT CONSULTED ON THIS MATTER.  HE CLAIMS HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THIS,
BUT WE HAVE OUR OWN SOURCES OF INFORMATION AND WE KNOW THAT HE KNEW.
BUT IF HE WANTS US TO BELIEVE HIM WHEN HE SAYS THAT HE DID NOT KNOW,
THEN THE FIRST THING HE SHOULD DO IS WHAT ANY MAN WITH ANY
SELF-RESPECT WOULD DO: ASK FOR AN INVESTIGATION.  HOWEVER, HE IS
HINDERING THE INVESTIGATION, WHICH IS WHAT IS ALWAYS DONE WHEN
SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS.  WHEN THINGS LIKE THIS HAPPEN, A FEW --
THOSE WHO WANT TO SEE MATTERS CLARIFIED -- RESIGN, WHILE OTHERS ARE
REMOVED. [CONTINUED]

   BOGOTA, 11 NOV 89 (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [TEXT] PEREIRA --
THREE PERSONS WERE INJURED AND HEAVY MATERIAL DAMAGE WAS REPORTED
DURING A NEW TERRORIST WAVE THAT HIT PEREIRA LAST NIGHT.  THREE BOMBS
EXPLODED AT THE FRONT DOORS OF A POLITICAL PARTY HEADQUARTERS AND TWO
BANKS.  THE ALMOST SIMULTANEOUS BLASTS WERE HEARD AT APPROXIMATELY
MIDNIGHT.  THE RESIDENTS IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA WERE SHAKEN BY THE
EXPLOSIONS.  INJURED BY THE SHOCK WAVE WERE: AN UNIDENTIFIED TAXI
DRIVER; ELMER MACHADO, A YOUNG BEGGAR WHO WAS SLEEPING ON THE SIDEWALK
NEAR ONE OF THE BANKS; AND RAUL CASTANO GUTIERREZ, A BAKER WHO WAS
PASSING BY.  THE INJURED PERSONS WERE TAKEN TO THE SOCIAL SECURITY'S
SAN JORGE HOSPITAL AND THE PIO XII CLINIC, AND IT WAS REPORTED THAT
THEY ARE OUT OF DANGER.

   GLASS WAS BROKEN AND OFFICE FURNITURE AND EQUIPMENT DESTROYED AT
THE LIBERAL UNITY HEADQUARTERS, A GROUP THAT FOLLOWS THE GUIDELINES OF
PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL CESAR GAVIRIA TRUJILLO; AT THE LAS VILLAS SAVINGS
AND LOANS OFFICE; AND AT THE INTERNATIONAL BANK OF COLOMBIA BRANCH.
THE PEREIRA SECURITY COUNCIL, PRESIDED OVER BY MUNICIPAL SECRETARY
BERNARDO GIL JARAMILLO, IS CURRENTLY HOLDING AN URGENT MEETING.
SECRETARY GIL JARAMILLO SAID THAT THE MOST DRASTIC AND EFFECTIVE
MEASURES WILL BE ADOPTED TO BRING THE SITUATION UNDER CONTROL, TO FIND
THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR LAST NIGHT'S ATTACKS, AND TO PREVENT FURTHER
INCIDENTS.

   THE ATTACK ON THE LIBERAL UNITY HEADQUARTERS OCCURRED A FEW HOURS
AFTER THE DIRECTORATE CALLED A MEETING WITH CIVIC, UNION, CULTURAL,
SPORTS, AND RELIGIOUS GROUPS TO CHOOSE THEIR CANDIDATE FOR MAYOR.  THE
CANDIDATE WILL RUN ON THE ALVARISTA CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT TICKET
HEADED BY SENATOR EMILIANO ISAZA ENAO.

   THIS IS THE SECOND ATTACK IN 2 MONTHS.  ON 6 SEPTEMBER THREE BOMBS
EXPLODED -- THREE OTHERS WERE DEFUSED -- RESULTING IN 60 MILLION PESOS
IN DAMAGE AND 17 PERSONS INJURED.  ONE OF THE INJURED LOST A LEG.

   SAN SALVADOR, 12 NOV 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] TWO HOURS AFTER THE
LAUNCHING OF A GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE AGAINST MILITARY POSITIONS, THE
SOUND OF MACHINEGUNS AND EXPLOSIVE DEVICES IS STILL BEING HEARD IN
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL.

   THE OFFENSIVE, WHICH BEGAN AT 2000 (0200 GMT), ALSO INCLUDES
MILITARY POSITIONS IN THE DEPARTMENTS OF USULUTAN AND SAN MIGUEL, IN
THE EASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY, ACCORDING TO REPORTS.

   MILITARY SOURCES HAVE CONFIRMED THE SIMULTANEOUS ATTACKS IN SAN
SALVADOR AND EYEWITNESSES HAVE REPORTED CLASHES IN RESIDENTIAL
NEIGHBORHOODS AND TOWNS OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL SUCH AS AYUTUXTEPEQUE,
CIUDAD DELGADO, SAN RAMON, MEJICANOS, AND SOYAPANGO.

   LIKEWISE, IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE ATTACKS WERE INTENSIFIED IN
VARIOUS NEIGHBORHOODS, SUCH AS CIUDAD MERLIOT, IN WESTERN SAN
SALVADOR.

   LOCAL RADIO STATIONS ANNOUNCED A NATIONAL RADIO NETWORK, WHILE ARMY
SPOKESMEN, WHICH HAVE YET TO GIVE A REPORT ON THE OFFENSIVE, ASKED THE
PEOPLE TO REMAIN HOME AND THOSE WHO ARE AWAY FROM THEIR HOMES, TO STAY
WHERE THEY ARE RIGHT NOW.

   ACCORDING TO THE ARMED FORCES, THE SITUATION IS "UNDER CONTROL" AND
"PEOPLE MUST REMAIN CALM."

   RADIO STATIONS HAVE JOINED A NATIONAL NETWORK AND ARE ONLY
TRANSMITTING MUSIC, WHICH IS INTERRUPTED TO BROADCAST REPORTS ON THE
MILITARY SITUATION.

   TWO RED CROSS AMBULANCES WERE DESTROYED AFTER BEING SHOT AT.

   HELICOPTERS WERE HEARD FLYING OVER THE CAPITAL, WHICH IN CERTAIN
AREAS, SUCH AS CIUDAD MERLIOT, ARE CARRYING OUT INTENSE BOMBINGS
AGAINST POSITIONS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
GUERRILLAS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 12 NOV 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] NINE PEOPLE WERE
WOUNDED--SEVEN CIVILIANS AND TWO SOLDIERS--DURING AN OFFENSIVE
LAUNCHED BY THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS IN THE CAPITAL AND OTHER
SALVADORAN CITIES, HUMANITARIAN INSTITUTIONS HAVE REPORTED.

   DURING THE OFFENSIVE, GUERRILLAS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) ATTACKED PRESIDENT CRISTIANI'S RESIDENCE AND
MILITARY GARRISONS IN THE CAPITAL AND OTHER CITIES.

   THE RED CROSS SENT DOZENS OF AMBULANCES TO THE AREAS MOST EFFECTED
TO EVACUATE THE INJURED AND CITIZENS WHO WERE TRAPPED IN THE CROSSFIRE
BETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE GUERRILLAS.

   EARLY SUNDAY MORNING, SPORADIC BOMB EXPLOSIONS AND MACHINEGUN FIRE
COULD STILL BE HEARD IN SOME PARTS OF SAN SALVADOR. THE ARMY HAS
IMPLEMENTED STRICT CONTROL ON THE DESERTED STREETS.

   RADIO STATIONS WERE ASKED TO JOIN A RADIO NETWORK FROM WHERE THE
GOVERNMENT HAS URGED THE POPULATION TO REMAIN CALM. THE NETWORK IS
CARRYING INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC WHICH IS INTERRUPTED BY "NEWS BULLETINS"
READ BY ARMY SPOKESMEN.

   ALTHOUGH ACCORDING TO REPORTS, NINE PEOPLE WERE HURT, NEITHER THE
ARMY NOR THE GUERRILLAS HAVE ISSUED AN OFFICIAL REPORT ON THE POSSIBLE
NUMBER OF CASUALTIES.

   ACCORDING TO POLITICAL OBSERVERS, THIS HAS BEEN THE GUERILLAS'
LARGEST MILITARY OFFENSIVE IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, AND THE ONE HAVING
THE MOST SERIOUS EFFECTS IN THE CAPITAL.

CONTINUED THROUGHOUT THE CITY EARLY THIS MORNING.

   THE INFORMATION REVEALS THAT ROADBLOCKS HAVE BEEN BUILT ON THE
HIGHWAY TO SAN SALVADOR AND THE ROAD TO TACACHICO.  IT HAS ALSO BEEN
CONFIRMED THAT THREE RIFLES WERE SEIZED FROM THE 2D INFANTRY
 BRIGADE TROOPS.

   ATTENTION, REPORTS FROM THE CAPITAL CONFIRM THAT FIERCE FIGHTING
HAS TAKEN PLACE AROUND THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE; AND LOTS OF RIFLES,
MACHINEGUNS, AND OTHER WEAPONS WERE SEIZED FROM DEATH SQUAD LEADER
[COLONEL FRANCISCO] ELENA FUENTES' TROOPS AT THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE.
OUR MEN HAVE SEIZED THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE TROOPS' RIFLES AND
MACHINEGUNS, WHILE AMBUSHES IN DIFFERENT POINTS OF THE CAPITAL HAVE
MULTIPLIED.

   THE ARMY'S DETACHMENTS HAVE BEEN IMMOBILIZED SO THE AIR FORCE
HELICOPTERS ARE NOW BEING USED TO EVACUATE PERSONNEL, LANDING IN
SEVERAL POINTS OF THE CAPITAL WHICH THE ARMY CANNOT REACH.

   MEANWHILE, FMLN FORCES ATTACKED A POLICE PATROL CAR IN THE
CAPITAL, ANNIHILATED ALL THE PASSENGERS, AND SEIZED THE VEHICLE.

DEV-MUC3-0687 (GE)

   SAN SALVADOR, 12 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [SPEECH] [PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI] [TEXT] [CRISTIANI, IN PROGRESS] ...ADDRESS YOU ON
THIS OCCASION TO EXPLAIN THE SITUATION WHICH HAS ARISEN, A
REPREHENSIBLE SITUATION CAUSED BY THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT] WHICH ONCE AGAIN IS ENDANGERING THE LIVES OF THE
CIVILIAN POPULATION IN EL SALVADOR.

   WE BELIEVE IT IS UNJUSTIFIABLE, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, FOR THE
FMLN TO CARRY OUT THIS TYPE OF ACTION, WHICH IS NOT A MILITARY ACTION,
KNOWING THAT A PEACE PROCESS IS UNDERWAY.  THESE ARE ACTIONS THAT
GO....[CHANGES THOUGHT] THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS THE ONES WHO
PAY MOST DEARLY FOR THE F M L N'S IRRATIONAL ATTITUDE.  THIS IS PROVED
BY THE DEPLORABLE INCIDENT WHICH OCCURRED YESTERDAY MORNING, WHEN TWO
SMALL CHILDREN -- 4- YEARS OLD AND 1- YEAR OLD -- DIED AS A RESULT OF
THE F M L N'S IRRATIONAL ACTIONS.

   WE BELIEVE, SALVADORAN PEOPLE, THAT THE PEACE PROCESS IS
IRREVERSIBLE AND IT SHOULD OCCUR; AND IT HAS BEEN SUPPORTED -- NOT
ONLY BY YOU, AS PEOPLE WHO DEMAND PEACE AND TRANQUILITY, BUT ALSO BY
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY -- THROUGHOUT THESE MONTHS.  YOU HAVE BEEN
THE BEST WITNESSES OF THE EFFORTS EXERTED BY YOUR GOVERNMENT AT THE
INTERNATIONAL LEVEL AND OF THE SUPPORT....[CORRECTS HIMSELF] THE
UNDENIABLE SUPPORT RECEIVED FROM ALL THE NATIONS WHO ARE FRIENDS OF EL
SALVADOR.  ACTIONS LIKE THE ONES WHICH THE FMLN IS TRYING TO CARRY OUT
ARE NO LONGER JUSTIFIABLE.

   WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU THIS MORNING FOR THE WAY IN WHICH YOU,
WHO ARE PART OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE [AS HEARD], HAVE BEHAVED.  WE
CANNOT BUT STATE OUR GRATITUDE FOR THE MANY STATEMENTS WE HAVE BEEN
HEARING THROUGH THE NATIONAL NETWORK WHICH BEGAN LAST NIGHT,
PARTICULARLY THE SUPPORT YOU HAVE GIVEN TO YOUR ARMED FORCES.

   THE ARMED FORCES ARE BENT ON STOPPING THE TERRORISTS AND
PROTECTING YOU, MEANING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  THE ARMED
 FORCES ARE A PROFESSIONAL CORPS; AND THE ARMED FORCES ARE
PREPARED TO COUNTER ANY IRRATIONAL   FMLN ACTION -- EVEN THIS
ONE, WHICH IS ONLY BEING CARRIED OUT FOR PUBLICITY PURPOSES
WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT, WHICH IS
ISSUING FALSE STATEMENTS THROUGH A NETWORK THAT HAS BEEN
ESTABLISHED BETWEEN RADIO SANDINO AND RADIO VENCEREMOS.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE, OUR ARMED FORCES CONTROL THE SITUATION.  THE
ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO THIS THANKS TO YOUR SUPPORT AND
COOPERATION; AND THE TERRORISTS WILL BE FORCED TO GATHER IN
INCREASINGLY SMALLER PLACES.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE ARMED FORCES WILL
DEFINITELY CONTROL THE SITUATION IN A SHORT TIME.  HOWEVER, IT IS
NECESSARY TO CONTINUE RECEIVING YOUR SUPPORT.  THE ARMED FORCES DO NOT
WANT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, TO ENDANGER THE LIFE OF EVEN ONE SINGLE
CIVILIAN; BUT THEY WILL SEE TO IT THAT THE TERRORISTS RECEIVE WHAT
THEY DESERVE ON THIS OCCASION, WHEN THEY HAVE CAUSED SO MUCH DAMAGE TO
THE POPULATION, ITSELF.

   WE BELIEVE IT IS NECESSARY FOR YOU TO HEED THE CALL NOT TO GO OUT
ON TO THE STREETS; TO STAY AT HOME OR AT THE RESIDENCE IN WHICH YOU
ARE RIGHT NOW -- EVEN IF IT IS NOT YOUR OWN -- BECAUSE IT IS NOW A
MATTER OF TIME.  I REPEAT, WE DO NOT WANT ANY MORE CASUALTIES AS A
RESULT OF THE F M L N'S IRRATIONAL ATTITUDE. [CONTINUED]

DEV-MUC3-0691 (GE)

   SAN SALVADOR, 12 NOV 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] THE DAUGHTER OF THE
EGYPTIAN AMBASSADOR TO EL SALVADOR, WHO HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE RED
CROSS AS NEDINA ELKACHES [AS RECEIVED], WAS WOUNDED IN THIS CAPITAL
THE EVENING OF 11 NOVEMBER DURING HEAVY CLASHES BETWEEN ARMY TROOPS
AND FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) GUERRILLAS.

   THE INFORMATION WAS CONFIRMED BY SALVADORAN RED CROSS SPOKESMAN
CARLOS LOPEZ, WHO SAID THAT NEDINA ELKACHES WAS WOUNDED NEAR THE
PRESIDENTIAL RESIDENCE.

   IT WAS FIRST REPORTED THAT THE WOUNDED WOMAN WAS THE ISRAELI
AMBASSADOR'S DAUGHTER, BUT THIS NEWS WAS DENIED TODAY.

   LOPEZ ADDED THAT A FOREIGNER NAMED ERIKA SULEMAN, PRESUMABLY A
 GERMAN NATIONAL, WAS KILLED IN THE SAME INCIDENT.                       

   BOTH WERE TRAVELING IN A CAR THAT WAS APPARENTLY CAUGHT IN THE
CROSSFIRE BETWEEN GUERRILLAS AND SOLDIERS.

   THE RED CROSS SPOKESMAN REPORTED THAT THE EGYPTIAN DIPLOMAT'S
DAUGHTER, WHO RECEIVED TWO SHOTS IN THE CHEST, UNDERWENT EMERGENCY
SURGERY IN A CAPITAL CITY HOSPITAL, AND THIS MORNING "HER STATUS IS
DELICATE, BUT SHE IS OUT OF DANGER."

   CLANDESTINE, 12 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] SALVADORAN,
CENTRAL AMERICAN, LATIN AMERICAN BROTHERS: YOU ARE LISTENING TO RADIO
VENCEREMOS, THE VOICE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH DETERMINATION
TO ATTAIN DEMOCRACY.  WE REPORT TO OUR FIGHTERS THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
TUNE IN, TO ALL OUR PEOPLE, AND THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD THAT THE FLMN
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] FORCES HAVE CONDUCTED MORE
THAN 18 HOURS OF HEROIC COMBAT IN SAN SALVADOR, THE COUNTRY'S MAIN
CITIES, AND IN THE HIGHWAYS.  AT THIS POINT, OUR MEN HAVE DOWNED TWO
HELICOPTERS AND DESTROYED THREE MORE HELICOPTERS THAT WERE ON LAND.
THIS BRINGS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HELICOPTERS TAKEN OUT OF COMBAT TO
FIVE.  WE HAVE ALSO DAMAGED TWO MORE ARMY ARMED VEHICLES AND THIS
BRINGS THE TOTAL TO HALF A DOZEN.  THESE NUMBERS HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED.
WE HAVE ALSO DESTROYED 12 LIGHT TANKS.  OUR PERSONNEL HAVE TAKEN
CONTROL OF THE MUNICIPAL MAYORS' OFFICES IN SEVERAL PLACES THROUGHTOUT
THE COUNTRY, INCLUDING THE CAPITAL CITY.  ALSO, IN SAN SALVADOR WE
HAVE TAKEN SEVERAL PRISONERS OF WAR.  THEY ARE PART OF THE REPRESSIVE
FORCES OF THE NATIONAL POLICE AND THE BELLOSO BATTALION.  WE HAVE ALSO
CONFISCATED A LARGE SUPPLY OF WAR MATERIEL FROM THE FASCISTS ENEMY
FORCES.  THESE WEAPONS ARE NOW IN THE HANDS OF OUR PEOPLE AND ARE NOW
GOING TO BE USED TO SHOOT THE FASCISTS.  THESE WEAPONS ARE IN THE
HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO USE THEM TO ATTAIN JUSTICE FOR THE
MURDERS OF FEBE ELIZABETH VELASQUEZ, OTHER COOPERATIVISTS, THE TEN
UNION LEADERS, AND MSGR ARNULFO ROMERO.  THESE WEAPONS IN THE HANDS OF
THE PEOPLE ARE A GUARANTEE FOR JUSTICE, DEMOCRACY, AND PEACE.

   ATTENTION, ATTENTION, THIS IS LAST MINUTE INFORMATION THAT HAS BEEN
RECEIVED BY RADIO VENCEREMOS.  ATTENTION SALVADORANS AND PRESS
AGENCIES THAT ARE MONITORING OUR GUERRILLA RADIO STATION.  WE HAVE
RECEIVED REPORTS THAT BOMBINGS CONTINUE IN SAN SALVADOR.
INDISCRMINATE BOMBING CONTINUES IN SAN SALVADOR.  WE HAVE RECEIVED
REPORTS OF INDISCRIMINATE BOMBING IN ZACAMIL, SOYAPANGO, AND SAN
MARCOS NEIGHBORHOODS.  THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LIVE IN THESE AREAS.  THESE
NEIGHBORHOODS ARE DENSELY POPULATED.  WE ALSO RECEIVED THE REPORT THAT
A DEATH SQUAD HEADED BY COLONEL FRANCISCO ELENA FUENTES HAS AGAIN
TAKEN ACTIONS AGAINST A CIVILIAN POPULATION JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE
UNABLE TO COMBAT OUR PERSONNEL.  THIS SQUAD ENTERED THE SALVADORAN
UNIVERSITY FROM THE AREA WHERE THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE IS LOCATED.
WE MUST NOTE THAT THE UNIVERSITY IS NEAR THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE
HEADQUARTERS.  THEY CAPTURED 13 CIVILIANS, BLINDFOLDED, TIED, AND TOOK
THEM INTO THAT MILITARY HEADQUARTERS.  ELENA FUENTES -- THAT
REPUDIABLE MURDERER, THAT ASSASSIN GORRILLA -- COWARDLY ATTACKS THE
CIVILIAN POPULATION AS HE IS UNABLE TO COMBAT THE PEOPLE'S ARMED
PERSONNEL.  FUENTES IS UNABLE TO STRIKE BACK SO HE ATTACKS MOTHERS AND
UNION MEMBERS.  THIS IS WHAT THIS TWO-BIT COLONEL IS ACCUSTOMED TO
DOING.  HE STRIKES OUT AT THE PEOPLE.  LET HIM COME OUT AND FIGHT THE
REBELS IN SAN SALVADOR.  OUR PEOPLE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF DEATH
SQUADS, POVERTY, REPRESSION, AND FASCIST TOTALITARIANISM.  WE ARE
TOTALLY DECIDED AND FIRMLY DETERMINED TO OVERCOME THE FASCIST
LATANDONA OFFICERS [NAME GIVEN TO 1966 GRADUATES OF CAPTAIN GERARDO
BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMY].  SALVADORAN PEOPLE: AS ONE STRONG FIST, LET
US ALL JOIN TOGETHER AND STRIKE THE FASCISTS.  LET'S TAKE IT TO THE
HILT.

DEV-MUC3-0711 (U NEBRASKA)

   SAN SALVADOR, 13 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] ACCORDING TO CIVILIAN
EYEWITNESSES, SALVADORAN ARMY TROOPS BOMBED THE UNIVERSITY'S SCHOOL OF
MEDICINE.

   THE SAME SOURCES REPORTED THAT SOLDIERS OF THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE
CAPTURED AND BLINDFOLDED 10 UNIVERSITY GUARDS YESTERDAY AND THEN TOOK THEM
OFF THE CAMPUS.

   ACCORDING TO THESE EYEWITNESSES, ARMY TROOPS ENTERED THE UNIVERSITY OF
EL SALVADOR USING AN ARMORED VEHICLE AND A 105-MM CANNON.  THEY SAID THAT
THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE WAS BOMBED LATER ON.  HOWEVER, OFFICIAL SOURCES
HAVE NEITHER CONFIRMED NOR DENIED THIS REPORT.

   THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES HAVE ACCUSED THE UNIVERSITY
OF EL SALVADOR OF BEING A GUERRILLA "SANCTUARY" AND HAVE SAID THAT THE 1ST
INFANTRY BRIGADE WAS ATTACKED FROM THE CAMPUS.

   IN ADDITION, THESE EYEWITNESSES SAID THAT 10 UNIVERSITY "GUARDS" WERE
CAPTURED ON CAMPUS, WHICH IS LOCATED NEAR THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE, ONE OF
THE GARRISONS ATTACKED BY THE GUERRILLAS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE REBEL
OFFENSIVE BEGUN ON THE NIGHT OF 11 NOVEMBER.

   ACCORDING TO THESE SOURCES, THE SOLDIERS SEIZED PROPAGANDA MATERIAL.

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) BEGAN AN OFFENSIVE
ON 11 NOVEMBER, WHICH HAS INCLUDED AN ATTACK ON THE HOMES OF IMPORTANT
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, INCLUDING THAT OF SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI.

   ON THE SAME NIGHT, THE REBELS ALSO ATTACKED THE NATIONAL POLICE
HEADQUARTERS IN ZACAMIL, ONE OF THE MOST POPULATED NEIGHBORHOODS IN
NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR, AS WELL AS MILITARY POSITIONS IN A DOZEN
RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS LOCATED IN VARIOUS SECTORS OF THIS CAPITAL. THE
FIGHTING THEN SPREAD TO SANTA ANA, CABANAS, LA PAZ, SAN VICENTE, SAN
MIGUEL, AND USULUTAN DEPARTMENTS IN THE COUNTRY'S NORTH, CENTRAL, AND
EASTERN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.

   THE REBEL OFFENSIVE HAS ALREADY RESULTED IN HUNDREDS OF CASUALTIES --
APPROXIMATELY 300 ACCORDING TO THE ARMY, AND 400 ACCORDING TO THE
GUERRILLAS.  THIS COMPELLED THE GOVERNMENT TO IMPOSE A STATE OF SIEGE AND
A CURFEW THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.

DEV-MUC3-0718 (U NEBRASKA)

   CLANDESTINE, 13 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] THIS IS A LAST
MINUTE REPORT BROUGHT TO YOU THROUGH THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY
NETWORK, RADIO FARABUNDO MARTI AND RADIO VENCEREMOS IN NETWORK
BROADCASTING TO THE WHOLE COUNTRY.  THIS LAST MINUTE REPORT STATES
THAT THE AIR FORCE HAS BOMBED AND STRAFED THE AREA ACROSS FROM THE
INCA FACTORY AND PRADOS DE VENECIA IN SOYAPANGO.  AS A RESULT OF THIS
BOMBING AND STRAFING ACTION 3 PERSONS HAVE BEEN KILLED AND 12 INJURED.
IN PRADOS DE VENECIA HOUSES HAVE BEEN TOTALLY DESTROYED.

   ATTENTION, WE CALL THIS INFORMATION TO THE ATTENTION OF THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS, AND INTERNATIONAL
HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS.  THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS AS A RESULT OF THE
BOMBINGS IN SAN SALVADOR IS INCREASING.  ACROSS FROM THE INCA FACTORY AND
PRADOS DE VENECIA IN SOYAPANGO, THE AIR FORCE IS INDISCRIMINATELY BOMBING
AND STRAFING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  ATTENTION, THE REPORT WE HAVE
RECEIVED FROM SAN SALVADOR ADVISES US THAT 3 PERSONS HAVE BEEN KILLED AND
12 INJURED AND HOUSES DESTROYED IN PRADOS DE VENECIA AS A RESULT OF THE
INDISCRIMINATE BOMBING BY THE AIR FORCE.  

   THE GENOCIDAL AND COWARDLY ATTITUDE OF THE AIR FORCE, BOMBING AREAS
JUST LIKE ANASTASIO SOMOZA DID DURING THE LAST DAYS OF HIS DICTATORSHIP,
IS SHOWING THE WORLD:

   1.  THE FASCIST NATURE OF ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S REGIME.  THE FASCIST
NATURE OF LA TANDONA [REFERENCE TO THE 1966 GRADUATES OF CAPTAIN
GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMNY] HAS REMOVED THE CIVILIAN MASK OFF
THE GOVERNMENT'S FACE AND SHOWN ITS REAL MILITARY AND FASCIST FACE.

   2.  THESE BOMBINGS PROVE THAT AS THE HOURS GO BY THEY BECOME MORE
DESPERATE AND HAVE LOST TOTAL CONTROL OF THE SITUATION.  THE PROMISES
MADE BY CRISTIANI AND THE DEFENSE MINISTER THAT THEY WOULD GET THE
SITUATION UNDER CONTROL ON SATURDAY HAS FAILED.  ON SATURDAY NIGHT
COLONEL [RENE] PONCE PROMISED TO BRING THE SITUATION UNDER CONTROL ON
SATURDAY NIGHT, HOWEVER, MORE THAN 32 HOURS HAVE GONE BY AND THE ARMED
FORCES AND THE HIGH COMMAND HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO STOP THE
REVOLUTIONARY ADVANCE IN SAN SALVADOR, SAN MIGUEL, AND THROUGHOUT THE
COUNTRY.

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT'S [FMLN] MILITARY
POSITIONS IN SAN SALVADOR ARE BEING CONSOLIDATED AFTER MORE THAT 32 HOURS
OF UNINTERRUPTED FIGHTING.  THE PLAN FOR THE DEFENSE OF SAN SALVADOR HAS
FAILED.  THE U.S. ADVISERS AND THE HIGH COMMAND HAVE BEEN PREPARING THIS
PLAN FOR MONTHS.  WE HEREBY ADVISE THE PEOPLE THAT THE PLAN FOR THE
DEFENSE OF SAN SALVADOR HAS FAILED.  THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO PREVENT OUR
FORCES FROM ARMING AND GETTING SUPPLIES; THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO STOP OUR
FMLN FORCES FROM ENTERING SAN SALVADOR, AND THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO
STOP OUR ADVANCE OR RECOVER A SINGLE INCH OF THE CITY OCCUPIED BY THE
FMLN.  WE CAN STATE THAT THE ARMED FORCES HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO WIN BACK A
SINGLE INCH OF TERRITORY UNDER OUR CONTROL IN MEJICANOS, AYUTUXTEPEQUE,
CUSCATANCINGO, ZACAMIL, UNIVERSITARIA NORTE, OR SOYAPANGA.  THE ARMED
FORCES HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ADVANCE A SINGLE INCH.  EVERY SINGLE STEP IN
AN ATTEMPT TO WIN BACK THE NEIGHBORHOODS WE OCCUPY HAS COST THEM DEARLY IN
DEAD AND WOUNDED.

HIDE THEIR FAILED ARMED ADVENTURE AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES HAVE PROFESSIONALLY REPELLED MOST OF
THE INVADERS' REDOUBTS, THROUGH WHICH THE FMLN IS ATTEMPTING TO SEIZE
POWER THROUGH A GENERALIZED MASSACRE AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

DEV-MUC3-0759 (U NEBRASKA)

   SAN SALVADOR, 16 NOV (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] A SPOKESWOMAN FOR THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF THE RED CROSS (CICR) HAS DECLARED THAT THE
CICR HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO ENTER THE AREAS AFFECTED BY LAST NIGHT'S
FIERCE FIGHTING AND BOMBING "BECAUSE THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES FROM THE
GOVERNMENT."

   MARIE AUDE LUDE, CICR SPOKESWOMAN IN EL SALVADOR TOLD ACAN - EFE
THAT "WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY REPLY FROM THE AUTHORITIES REGARDING
OUR REQUEST FOR A 6-HOUR TRUCE MADE ON 15 NOVEMBER."

   SHE SAID THAT, "WE CAN NOT OPERATE UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES."

   SHE SAID, HOWEVER, THAT THE SALVADORAN RED CROSS HAS BEEN ACTIVE.
SHE CONFIRMED THAT FIVE OF ITS AMBULANCES HAVE BEEN SHOT AT SINCE THE
FIGHTING BETWEEN THE GUERRILLAS AND THE ARMY STARTED IN THE STREETS OF
SAN SALVADOR ON 11 NOVEMBER.

   THREE MEMBERS OF THE LOCAL RED CROSS HAVE BEEN WOUNDED IN THE LAST
5 DAYS.

   INDEPENDENT OBSERVERS ARRIVING FROM THE ZACAMIL AND MEJICANOS
NEIGHBORHOODS THIS MORNING REPORTED THAT THERE WERE MANY CASUALTIES
DURING LAST NIGHT'S FIGHTING. THEY SAID THAT THE AIR FORCE
CONTINUOUSLY MACHINEGUNNED GUERRILLA POSITIONS IN THE DENSLY POPULATED
AREAS.

   THE CICR HAS ASKED THE TWO SIDES TO DECREE A 6-HOUR TRUCE TO
EVACUATE THE WOUNDED AND BURY THE MANY BODIES THAT ARE SPREAD
THROUGOUT THE CITY.  SOME CORPSES ARE DECAYING BECAUSE OF THE HEAT
DURING THE DAY IN THIS CITY.

DEV-MUC3-0760 (U NEBRASKA)

   WASHINGTON DC (UNITED STATES), 16 NOV 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] SALVADORAN
FOREIGN MINISTER JOSE MANUEL PACAS CASTRO TODAY CONDEMNED THE
ASSASSINATION OF SIX JESUITS AND TWO WOMEN IN HIS COUNTRY, AND HE
BLAMED THE ULTRALEFTIST GROUPS FOR IT, ALTHOUGH HE SAID HE HAD NO
PROOF.

   "IT IS A REPUGNANT CRIME," SAID THE FOREIGN MINISTER, WHO WAS
ATTENDING THE 19TH OAS GENERAL ASSEMBLY, AND HE DESCRIBED THE
ASSASSINATIONS AS A "DESPERATE ACTION TAKEN BY THE LEFT."

   JOAO BAENA SOARES, SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE OAS, WAS ASKED TODAY TO
REPORT TO THE ASSEMBLY ON THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR IN COMPLIANCE
WITH THE RESOLUTION ON THAT COUNTRY THAT WAS APPROVED ON TUESDAY.

   A COMMUNIQUE RELEASED TODAY BY A FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] SPOKESMAN IN WASHINGTON BLAMED THE SALVADORAN
ARMY FOR THE CRIME, AND ADDED THAT "ALL OF THE BODIES HAD BULLET
WOUNDS IN THE HEAD, INDICATING THAT THEY WERE EXECUTED."

   PACAS CASTRO SAID TODAY THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT, HEADED BY
ALFREDO CRISTIANI, WILL MAINTAIN ITS COMMITMENT TO A DIALOGUE TO
DISCUSS THE SUSPENSION OF THE HOSTILITIES AND TO IMPLEMENT AN INTERNAL
PEACE PROCESS.

   MOREOVER, HE ANNOUNCED THAT AN OFFICIAL MISSION, CAPABLE OF MAKING
DECISIONS AND COMMITMENTS, WILL TRAVEL TO CARACAS IN THE HOPE OF
MEETING WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FMLN GUERRILLAS.

   THE SALVADORAN FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THE SITUATION IN HIS COUNTRY
IS UNDER CONTROL AND THAT ARMY TROOPS ARE SLOWLY MOVING INTO THE
DENSELY POPULATED AREAS TO AVOID BLOODSHED AMONG THE CIVILIAN
POPULATION.

   AS FOR A REQUEST BY THE INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS TO CALL FOR A
CEASE-FIRE FOR HUMANITARIAN REASONS TO TREAT THE WOUNDED AND CIVILIAN
VICTIMS, PACAS CASTRO SAID THAT THE FIRST-AID BRIGADES CONTINUE TO DO
THEIR WORK IN EL SALVADOR.

   AS FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF THE SIX JESUITS AND THE TWO WOMEN, HE
SAID "HE CONDEMNED THIS TYPE OF VIOLENCE" BECAUSE IGNACIO ELLACURIA,
ONE OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS WHO WAS KILLED, "WAS MY TEACHER," AND HE
DESCRIBED THE PRIEST AS A VERY VALUABLE MAN WHO WORKED FOR PEACE AND
FOR THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE POPULATION.

   COSTA RICAN FOREIGN MINISTER RODRIGO MADRIGAL NIETO, IN STATEMENTS
TO THE PRESS, REGRETTED THE DEATH OF THE CLERGYMEN.  "WORKING FOR
PEACE IS VERY DIFFICULT," HE SAID.

   MADRIGAL NIETO SAID TODAY HE HOPED THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE
GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLAS WOULD CONTINUE DESPITE THE WAR.

   GUATEMALAN FOREIGN MINISTER ARIEL RIVERA IRIAS SUPPORTED THE
STATEMENTS OF HIS COSTA RICAN COLLEAGUE, AND HE CONDEMNED THE USE OF
VIOLENCE AS A POLITICAL TOOL.

DEV-MUC3-0762 (U NEBRASKA)

   CLANDESTINE, 16 NOV 89 (CADENA REVOLUCIONARIA NACIONAL) --
[COMMUNIQUE] [GENERAL COMMAND OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN] [TEXT] IN VIEW OF THE SINISTER MASSACRE OF
JESUIT PRIESTS TODAY, THE FMLN REPORTS THE FOLLOWING TO THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE:

   1.  THE MASSACRE OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS IGNACIO ELLACURIA, SEGUNDO
MONTES, IGNACIO MARTIN BARO, JOAQUIN LOPEZ, AMANDO LOPEZ, AND JUAN
RAMON MORENO, ALONG WITH MRS JULIA ELBA RAMOS AND HER DAUGHTER CELINA
RAMOS, WAS PERPETRATED BY ARMED FORCES DEATH SQUADS AT DAWN TODAY.

   A GROUP OF ABOUT 30 MEN DRESSED IN GREEN STORMED INTO THE PRIESTS'
RESIDENCE AND RIDDLED THEM WITH BULLETS FIRED FROM HEAVY CALIBER
WEAPONS.  THREE OF THE BODIES WERE DRAGGED OUT TO THE PATIO WHERE THEY
WERE GIVEN DEATH BLOWS THAT COMPLETELY CRUSHED THEIR SKULLS.

   2.  THIS ABSURD MASSACRE AND THE GENOCIDAL BOMBINGS AGAINST HEAVILY
POPULATED AREAS IN SAN SALVADOR AND SAN MIGUEL HAVE BEEN ORDERED BY
ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND THE ARMED FORCES' HIGH COMMAND, AND ARE PART OF
A COUNTERINSURGENT PLAN TO DESTROY THE POLITICAL OPPOSITION AND CREATE
A STATE OF TERROR AMONG THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  PUBLIC DEATH THREATS
WERE MADE AGAINST PRIEST IGNACIO ELLACURIA OVER THE ARMED FORCES
NATIONAL NETWORK.

   THE NIGHT OF WEDNESDAY, 15 NOVEMBER, THE SECURITY CORPS SEARCHED
THE OFFICES OF THE OPPOSITION GROUPS LOOKING FOR THE LEADERS IN ORDER
TO KILL THEM.  THIS IS THE SAME SCHEME THEY USED IN 1979 AND 1980 WHEN
THEY MURDERED MONSIGNOR ROMERO AND MASSACRED THE REVOLUTIONARY
DEMOCRATIC FRONT LEADERS, UNIVERSITY RECTOR DR FELIX ULLOA, AND TENS
OF THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS.

   3.  THERE IS NO ROOM FOR DOUBT THAT THE ARENA [NATIONALIST
REVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE] REGIME AND THE ARMED FORCES ARE
FASCIST BEASTS THAT HAVE BEEN MORTALLY WOUNDED.  THEREFORE, WE CALL ON
DEMOCRATIC PEOPLES AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS TO PROTEST SUCH AN
UNFORTUNATE MASSACRE, AND ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO ISOLATE
THE FASCIST REGIME OF ALFREDO CRISTIANI.

   4.  WE CALL ON THE ARMED FORCES OFFICERS WHO KNEW FATHER IGNACIO
ELLACURIA -- AND RESPECTED HIM FOR HIS PAST HISTORY IN THE FIELDS OF
EDUCATION, RESEARCH, AND SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS OF THE TRUE SITUATION --
TO TAKE A DIGNIFIED AND DETERMINED STAND AND NOT STAIN THEIR HANDS
WITH THE BLOOD OF GENOCIDE.

   THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HONEST PATRIOTS IN THE ARMED FORCES WHO DO
NOT HAVE TO SINK WITH THE CRIMINALS.  WE OFFER THEM OUR HANDS, SO THAT
TOGETHER WE WILL SAVE THE COUNTRY, AND SO THEY WILL BE ABLE TO SAVE
PART OF THE ARMED FORCES.  ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND THE ARMED FORCES
ASSASSINATED THE JESUIT PRIESTS, BUT THEY ARE COMMITTING SUICIDE.

   5.  THE FMLN CONDEMNS THIS CRIME AND JOINS IN THE SORROW OF THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE WHO LOSE IN SUCH AN ABSURD MANNER SOME OF THE MOST
APPRECIATED INTELLECTUALS OF OUR COUNTRY.  THEIR INTELLIGENCE AND
SENSIBILITY WERE ALWAYS AT THE SERVICE OF CHANGE AND PROGRESS IN OUR
SOCIETY.  THEIR WORK WILL BE ETERNAL, AND THE FASCIST IRRATIONALITY
WILL NEVER PUT AN END TO THAT WORK.

   WE CALL ALL OF OUR COMMANDS, FIGHTERS, MILITANTS, AND OUR PEOPLE IN
GENERAL, TO UNTIRING COMBAT.  THIS STRUGGLE IS THE ONLY ANSWER WE HAVE
FOR THIS DESPICABLE MASSACRE.  WE MUST OUST ARENA AND LA TANDONA [1966
GRADUATING CLASS OF THE GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY SCHOOL].  THE
FATHERLAND IS COUNTING ON OUR STRENGTH AND OUR DETERMINATION, AND WE
WILL NOT FAIL THE FATHERLAND.

   [SIGNED] FMLN GENERAL COMMAND: COMMANDER SHAFIK JORGE HANDAL,
COMMANDER JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS, COMMANDER FRANCISCO JOVEL, COMMANDER
SALVADOR SANCHEZ CEREN, COMMANDER EDUARDO SANCHO

DEV-MUC3-0766 (U NEBRASKA)

   SAN SALVADOR, 16 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] WHEN ANSWERING A
QUESTION ON THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE SIX JESUITS AND TWO OTHER PERSONS
COULD HAVE BEEN MURDERED BY THE MILITARY, SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI SAID TODAY THAT "IF THE ARMED FORCES PEOPLE DID IT, THE
WEIGHT OF THE LAW WILL FALL ALSO ON THEM."

   CRISTIANI "STRONGLY CONDEMNED" THE MULTIPLE MURDER THAT TOOK PLACE
EARLY THIS MORNING AND ATTRIBUTED IT TO "GROUPS OR MINDS THAT WANT TO
HINDER THE PROCESS OF DEMOCRACY AND PEACE THAT HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT IN
EL SALVADOR."

   THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WAS DETERMINED "TO INVESTIGATE THIS TO THE
VERY END, REGARDLESS OF WHO DID IT."

   HE EMPHASIZED THAT IT IS TOO EARLY "TO GIVE ANY OPINION" ON WHO
COULD HAVE COMMITTED THE MURDERS, POINTING OUT THAT THE FACT THE MEN
WHO DID IT WERE WEARING UNIFORMS AND WERE MOVING AT NIGHT DURING THE
STRICT CURFEW IN THE CITY "IS NOT CONCLUSIVE."

   CRISTIANI SAID THAT "THE ARMED FORCES AS WELL AS THE GUERRILLA
GROUPS MOVE DURING THE CURFEW HOURS."

   HE STATED THAT IN AGREEMENT WITH THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF,
WITH WHOM HE MET THIS MORNING TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE, HE HAS ORDERED AN
INVESTIGATION.

   THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT DISCLOSED THE EXISTENCE OF "A POSSIBLE
WITNESS THAT HAS NOT BEEN INTERROGATED BY THOSE WHO ARE CARRYING OUT
THE INVESTIGATION" AND WHO HAVE FINGERPRINTS AND EMPTY CARTRIDGES OF
BULLETS FOR AK-47S AND M-16S.

   CRISTIANI DISAVOWED VERSIONS REPORTED DURING THE DAY BY THE
GOVERNMENT RADIO NETWORK THAT CLAIM THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) GUERRILLAS COMMITTED THE MURDER.

   IN ANOTHER PART OF HIS NEWS CONFERENCE, THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT
ADMITTED THAT WITHIN THE ARMED FORCES "THERE MIGHT GROUPS OF PERSONS
WHO DO NOT AGREE WITH THE GOVERNMENT," BUT HE ADDED THAT "AS AN
INSTITUTION, THEY ARE WITH THE GOVERNMENT."

DEV-MUC3-0769 (U NEBRASKA)

   PARIS (FRANCE), 16 NOV 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
ASSASSINATION OF SIX MEMBERS OF HIS ORDER, INCLUDING IGNACIO ELLACURIA,
RECTOR OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY (UCA), "ARE THE SAME ONES WHO
KILLED MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO, ARCHBISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR."

   "I DO NOT WANT TO ACCUSE ANYONE, BUT IT IS OBVIOUS WHERE THE FACTS ARE
POINTING," JOSE MARIA TOJEIRA [JESUIT PROVINCIAL SUPERVISOR] STATED AT A
NEWS CONFERENCE HELD THIS AFTERNOON IN THE UCA CHAPEL, ONLY A FEW METERS
FROM WHERE THE JESUIT PRIESTS AND TWO DOMESTICS WERE KILLED THIS MORNING.

   THE BODIES OF ELLACURIA AND HIS JESUIT COMPANIONS IGNACIO MARTIN
BARO, SEGUNDO MONTES, JUAN RAMON MORENO, ARMANDO LOPEZ, AND JOAQUIN
LOPEZ, AS WELL AS DOMESTIC ELBA RAMOS AND HER 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER,
WERE RIDDLED WITH BULLETS, WHILE SOME ALSO HAD THEIR SKILLS CRUSHED.

   THE DEATH OF THE PRIESTS, FIVE OF THEM SPANIARDS, WHO WERE ALWAYS
IN FAVOR OF A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS, HAS INCREASED THE
FEAR AND DESPERATION FELT BY THE SALVADORANS SINCE THE PAST WEEKEND,
WHEN VIOLENT FIGHTING BROKE OUT BETWEEN THE GUERRILLAS AND SOLDIERS IN
THE NORTHERN PART OF SAN SALVADOR.

   THE PRIESTS WERE KILLED BY SOME 30 MEN WEARING OLIVE DRAB UNIFORMS
WHO BROKE INTO THE PLACE, ACCORDING TO WITNESSES WHO WERE THERE,
TOJEIRA EXPLAINED.

   THE PRIEST RECALLED THAT OVER THE WEEKEND THE GOVERNMENT RADIO
NETWORK "LAUNCHED FIERCE ATTACKS AGAINST THE [WORD INDISTINCT], SAYING
THAT A FEW PRIESTS HAD TO BE KILLED IN THIS COUNTRY OR THAT THEY HAD
TO BE PLACED IN FRONT OF THE CATHEDRAL SO THAT THE PEOPLE COULD KILL
THEM BY SPITTING AT THEM," TOJERA NOTED.

   ALSO, HE ADDED THAT ON MONDAY ARMED FORCES MEMBERS RAIDED THE HOMES
OF ELLACURIA AND COMPANIONS.  "ON THAT OCCASION THEY WERE QUITE
CORRECT, ACCORDING TO WHAT FATHER ELLACURIA TOLD ME," ADDED TOJEIRA,
WHO WAS QUITE UPSET DURING THE NEWS CONFERENCE.

   "APPARENTLY THE MEN SAID THEY HAD REPORTS THAT THERE WERE WEAPONS
IN THE RESIDENCES.  OF COURSE THEY FOUND NOTHING, AND FATHER ELLACURIA
INVITED THEM TO RETURN ON TUESDAY AND GO THROUGH THE UCA CAMPUS, BUT
THEY DID NOT DO SO."

   ALSO, TOJEIRA CONFIRMED THAT ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING
THERE WAS TIGHT SECURITY IN THE VICINITY OF THE UCA IN THE SOUTHERN
PART OF THE CAPITAL.

   "I DO NOT KNOW IF THE SOLDIERS LEFT THE PLACE LATER, BUT UP UNTIL
2200 ON WEDNESDAY, HOURS BEFORE THE HORRIBLE MASSACRE, THE SOLDIERS
WERE THERE," TOJEIRA ADDED.

   "THESE ARE THE FACTS.  THEREFORE, WE SHARE THE OPINION OF
ARCHBISHOP ARTURO RIVERA -- THAT THE ONES RESPONSIBLE ARE THE SAME
ONES WHO ASSASSINATED MSGR ROMERO," HE ADDED.

DEV-MUC3-0771 (U NEBRASKA)

   SAN SALVADOR, 16 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [REPORT] [COLONEL
RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF] [TEXT]
SALVADORAN PEOPLE: AFTER 5 DAYS OF COMBAT, CONFRONTING THIS ARMED
AGGRESSION BY THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT]
TERRORISTS, [WORDS INDISTINCT] I WANT TO INFORM YOU OF THE SITUATION
THROUGHOUT THE NATION:

   IN THE WESTERN AREA, THERE ARE NO PROBLEMS.  IN THE EASTERN AREA,
THERE ARE STILL PROBLEMS.  IN SAN MIGUEL CITY, THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE
COMMAND HAS BEEN OPERATING IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER, AND IT HAS
AVOIDED HARMING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION; THEREFORE, THERE ARE
TERRORISTS IN THE [NAMES INDISTINCT] NEIGHBORHOODS.  ALSO IN USULUTAN
LAST NIGHT AND EARLY THIS MORNING, [WORDS INDISTINCT] BUT AT PRESENT
ONLY SOME EXPLOSIONS AND SOME SPORADIC FIRING ARE HEARD IN THE
VICINITY OF THE CITY OF USULUTAN.  IN ZACATECOLUCA YESTERDAY WE
MANAGED TO CONTROL THE POPULATION COMPLETELY.  WE DISLODGED THE
TERRORISTS FROM THE 27 SEPTEMBER NEIGHBORHOOD.

   WE HAVE HAD SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN THE CAPITAL CITY.  THE FMLN HAS
WAGED ITS GREATEST EFFORTS HERE. THEY ARE [WORD INDISTINCT]
TERRORISTS, AND THEY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS SUCH.  IN SOME
NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE NORTHERN AREA, THE [WORDS INDISTINCT] MEJICANOS,
[WORDS INDISTINCT] AS OF SUNDAY, 12 NOVEMBER. IN SOME [WORDS
INDISTINCT] AS IT WAS YESTERDAY.  ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE [WORDS
INDISTINCT] OF THE CAPITAL CITY.  IN MEJICANOS, IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,
[WORDS INDISTINCT] NORTH OF THE GUADALUPE AND SOYAPANGO NEIGHBORHOODS,
[WORDS INDISTINCT] REPARTO SANTA MARTA, AND ALTOS DEL [WORD
INDISTINCT]. IN THIS AREA, THE ARMED FORCES HAVE CARRIED OUT ACTIONS
TO DEFEND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO NEUTRALIZE THIS GENOCIDE [WORDS
INDISTINCT].

   ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL, I WOULD LIKE TO ANNOUNCE SOME PARTIAL
RESULTS. THE ARMED FORCES HAVE SUSTAINED THE FOLLOWING: 177 DEAD AND
251 WOUNDED.

   AMONG THE TERRORISTS THERE ARE 655 DEAD AND 491 WOUNDED.  WE HAVE
CAPTURED 92 FMLN MEMBERS, AND 6 FMLN TERRORISTS HAVE TURNED THEMSELVES
IN.  AS FOR THE CIVILIANS, WE REGRET 47 PERSONS HAVE DIED, AND 153
HAVE BEEN WOUNDED.

   THE ARMED FORCES HAVE SEIZED FROM THE FMLN TERRORISTS 324 RIFLES,
75 GRENADE AND ROCKET LAUNCHERS, 26 MORTARS, 8 MACHINEGUNS, 15
SUBMACHINEGUNS, AND 40 WEAPONS OF OTHER TYPES.  FOUR ARSENALS HAVE
ALSO [WORDS INDISTINCT] IN MEJICANOS, WHERE THE TERRORISTS HAD A
CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF AMMUNITION AND EXPLOSIVES.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE: YOU MUST HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOUR ARMED FORCES
AND IN YOUR GOVERNMENT BECAUSE WE ARE WORKING JOINTLY. OUR COMMANDER
IN CHIEF IS UP TO DATE ON THE SITUATION, AND [WORDS INDISTINCT], AND
WE ARE WORKING TOGETHER. THE ARMED FORCES IS WORKING IN A VERY
PROFESSIONAL MANNER. YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT WE CANNOT RESOLVE THIS
SITUATION BY ENDANGERING THE LIVES OF INNOCENT PEOPLE. THAT IS WHY IT
TAKES LONGER FOR THE ARMED FORCES TO DO THINGS.

   ON BEHALF OF THE ARMED FORCES, WE WANT TO THANK YOU, OUR PEOPLE,
FOR YOUR SUPPORT, AS YOU HAVE BEEN PROVIDING US WITH PLENTY OF
INFORMATION, SUPPORTING OUR TROOPS IN THE VARIOUS COMBAT AREAS, AND--
MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL--CONDEMNING AND REJECTING THIS TERRORIST
ATTACK. THAT IS THE [WORDS INDISTINCT] OF THE FMLN.

   WE ARE ALL WORKING, STRUGGLING TO MAINTAIN A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM, TO
MAINTAIN FREEDOM [WORD INDISTINCT], AND ACHIEVE PEACE. I ALSO WANT TO
INFORM YOU THAT AFTER VISITING THIS AFTERNOON THE VARIOUS AREAS WHERE
WE ARE [WORD INDISTINCT], THE MORALE OF OUR TROOPS AND OFFICERS IS
VERY HIGH. AND THERE IS A REASON FOR THIS, BECAUSE THEY ARE FIGHTING
TO DEFEND YOU.

   [WORD INDISTINCT] THE FMLN TERRORISTS HAVE A VERY LOW MORALE,
[WORDS INDISTINCT] MANY, BECAUSE THEY ARE NOW AWARE OF THEIR
CASUALTIES AND [WORDS INDISTINCT].

   I WANT TO AVAIL MYSELF OF THIS OPPORTUNITY AND ON BEHALF OF THE
ARMED FORCES, TO STRONGLY CONDEMN THOSE WHO THIS MORNING MASSACRED SIX
JESUIT PRIESTS. WE REGRET AS WELL THE DEATHS OF OTHER CIVILIANS,
INNOCENT PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS CONFLICT. WE ALSO
REGRET THE DEATHS AMONG OUR ARMED FORCES.

   IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT THE GOVERNMENT, THE PEOPLE,
AND THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL COMMAND ARE PROUD OF THE PROFESSIONAL
WORK BEING DONE AT THE VARIOUS GARRISONS OF OUR ARMED FORCES.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE, ON BEHALF OF THE ARMED FORCES, WE ASK FOR YOUR
SUPPORT. YOU MUST CONTINUE GOING TO WORK AND CONTINUE WORKING.  IN
CONCLUSION, I WANT TO THANK THE PEOPLE ONCE AGAIN FOR THEIR MORAL AND
MATERIAL SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES AT SUCH A
DIFFICULT TIME.

DEV-MUC3-0775 (U NEBRASKA)

   CLANDESTINE, 17 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] WE RECENTLY HEARD
U.S. AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER ON A SALVADORAN TELEVISION NEWSCAST.  HE SAID
NO ONE KNEW EXACTLY WHO HAD PLANNED THE MURDER OF FATHER IGNACIO ELLACURIA
AND THE OTHER JESUIT PRIESTS WHO WERE ASSASSINATED EARLY YESTERDAY MORNING.

   RADIO VENCEREMOS TELLS WILLIAM WALKER THAT HIS CYNICISM IS BEYOND
THE LIMIT.  WILLIAM WALKER KNOWS PERFECTLY WELL WHICH GENERAL STAFF
OFFICE ISSUED THE ORDER TO ASSASSINATE THE JESUIT PRIESTS.

   WILLIAM WALKER KNOWS THAT ON THE NIGHT OF 11 NOVEMBER RADIO
CUSCATLAN URGED THE PEOPLE TO ASSASSINATE IGNACIO ELLACURIA, RUBEN
ZAMORA, AND DOCTOR GUILLERMO UNGO.  THE WHOLE WORLD.... [CORRECTS
HIMSELF] THE INTERNATIONAL MEDIA HAS FEATURED THE RECORDING IN WHICH
RADIO CUSCATLAN -- THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF'S RADIO, MEANING THE
RADIO CONTROLLED BY THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF, THE RADIO IN WHICH
NOT A SINGLE WORD, NOT A SINGLE COMMA GOES OUT WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF
THE CENSORS WHICH HAVE BEEN IMPOSED ON RADIO CUSCATLAN - - [WORDS
INDISTINCT] DEATH.

   THEREFORE, WILLIAM WALKER KNOWS PERFECTLY WELL WHERE THE ORDER CAME
FROM; HE KNOWS THE EXACT TIME THAT 40 UNIFORMED MEN LEFT IN [WORDS
INDISTINCT] CURFEW, A FEW BLOCKS FROM COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE'S
OFFICE.  WILLIAM WALKER'S CYNICISM WENT BEYOND THE LIMIT WHEN HE SAID
THAT HE DOES NOT KNOW [WORDS INDISTINCT] OR WHO PLANNED IGNACIO
ELLACURIA'S ASSASSINATION.

   WILLIAM WALKER IS DOING A HISTORICAL IMITATION OF THE FILIBUSTER
WHO CAME TO CENTRAL AMERICA IN 1856 TO SUBJUGATE OUR PEOPLE AND BECOME
PRESIDENT OF A CENTRAL AMERICAN NATION, MEANING NICARAGUA, WHO DECREED
THAT ENGLISH BE THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE, AND THAT THE U.S.  FLAG BECOME
THE OCCUPATION FORCES' FLAG.  WILIAM WALKER IS RE- EDITING A SHAMEFUL
CHAPTER IN CENTRAL AMERICA'S HISTORY.  WILLIAM WALKER, THE U.S.
AMBASSADOR IN OUR HOMELAND, IS RE-EDITING -- IN THE FORM OF A
CARICATURE -- A HISTORICAL EVENT WHICH OCCURRED IN THE 19TH CENTURY.
HOWEVER, WE WANT TO TELL SOMETHING TO THE NEW WILLIAM WALKER, WHO HAS
BEEN FEATURED IN PRESS AND TELEVISION NEWS REPORTS GIVING FIGURES
WHICH DIFFER EVEN FROM THOSE GIVEN BY COL PONCE; THE NEW WILLIAM
WALKER, WHO THINKS HE IS PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND IS BETTER THAN
CRISTIANI AND COL PONCE, SO HE GIVES INVENTED FIGURES ON GUERRILLA
CASUALTIES; THE NEW WILLIAM WALKER, WHO EVALUATES THE NATION'S
POLITICAL AND MILITARY SITUATION, EVEN BEFORE CRISTIANI AND PONCE DO
SO, EVEN CONTRADICTING COL PONCE'S FIGURES.  WILLIAM WALKER SAID 40
MEMBERS OF THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] WERE
CAPTURED, YET THE BLEARY-EYED COL PONCE LAST NIGHT TALKED ABOUT 9 FMLN
MEMBERS.  WHERE, THEN, ARE THE REST OF THE CAPTURED FMLN FIGHTERS?

   HUMANITARIAN GROUPS SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO THAT CONTRADICTION
BETWEEN PRESIDENT WILLIAM WALKER AND HIS SUBORDINATE, COL PONCE.  RED
CROSS INTERNATIONAL, GREEN CROSS, AND AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL MUST
DEMAND THAT WILLIAM WALKER SAY WHERE THE CAPTURED GUERRILLA FIGHTERS
ARE, BECAUSE COL PONCE ONLY MENTIONS NINE FIGHTERS.  COL PONCE TALKS
ABOUT NINE AND THE OTHER ONE TALKS ABOUT DOZENS.  THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY MUST PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE CONTRADICTION BETWEEN
PRESIDENT WILLIAM WALKER AND HIS SUBORDINATE, COL PONCE.  WHERE ARE
THE OTHER CAPTURED FIGHTERS?  MOST OF THEM WERE SURELY CIVILIANS WHO
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CONFLICT.  THEY MUST HAVE BEEN CAUGHT IN
THE WAR ZONES AND THEN PRESENTED TO THE MEDIA AS DEAD GUERRILLA
FIGHTERS.

   WE DEMAND, BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, THAT AMBASSADOR
WILLIAM WALKER CLEARLY SAY HOW COL PONCE COULD HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN WHEN
ADMITTING THAT ONLY NINE GUERRILLA FIGHTERS WERE CAPTURED -- WHILE THE
U.S. AMBASSADOR PERSONALLY REVEALED THE FIGURES THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
REVEALED BY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI A LONG TIME AGO -- EVEN IF THEY WERE
IMAGINARY FIGURES.  WILLIAM WALKER MUST ANSWER THIS QUESTION: WHERE
ARE THE GUERRILLA FIGHTERS?

DEV-MUC3-0777 (PRC)

   HAVANA (CUBA), 17 NOV 89 (RADIO REBELDE NETWORK) -- [COMMENTARY]
[ORLANDO CONTRERAS] [TEXT] FIGHTING CONTINUES TODAY IN SAN SALVADOR,
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE TRIUMPHALIST TONE OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY
BEGINS TO CHANGE.  AN AP CABLE WE RECEIVED THIS MORNING IN OUR
NEWSROOM SAYS THE FOLLOWING: THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THEY
HAVE SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN VARIOUS SUBURBS OF THIS CAPITAL.  THIS IS
WHAT THE AP CABLE SAYS TEXTUALLY IN ITS HEADLINE.

   IN ADDITION TO THIS SITUATION, THERE IS ANOTHER FACT IN THE
BATTLEFIELD TO WHICH THE NEWS AGENCIES HAVE NOT PAID MUCH ATTENTION,
WHICH IS ALSO A REFLECTION OF THE TYPE OF COMBAT THAT THE SALVADORAN
FORCES ARE FIGHTING.  AP ITSELF SAYS THE FOLLOWING: THE WAR BECAME
DIRTY WITH THE MURDER OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS AND TWO WOMEN BY
UNIDENTIFIED TERRORISTS WHO ACTED DURING THE CURFEW.  FURTHERMORE, THE
CABLE SAYS THAT THE CANADIAN EMBASSY IN SAN SALVADOR REPORTED THAT 12
WORKERS FROM THE LUTHERAN CHURCH WERE ARRESTED BY UNIFORMED SECURITY
INDIVIDUALS IN DOWNTOWN SAN SALVADOR.  AT THE BEGINNING, THE CABLE
SAID THAT THE SIX PRIESTS HAD BEEN MURDERED BY UNIDENTIFIED
TERRORISTS.  LATER, THEY ARE IDENTIFIED AS UNIFORMED INDIVIDUALS.

   AMONG THE PRIESTS MURDERED WAS FATHER IGNACIO ELLACURIA, RECTOR OF
THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY AND DIRECTOR OF A MAGAZINE WHICH
REFLECTED THE PEOPLES' THOUGHTS, NOT ONLY IN EL SALVADOR BUT ALSO IN
THE REST OF CENTRAL AMERICA.  NONE OF THESE PRIESTS BELONGED TO THE
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN].  FURTHERMORE,
ELLACURIA HIMSELF ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS EXPRESSED OPINIONS WHICH DID
NOT CONCUR WITH THOSE OF THE FMLN.  HOWEVER, HE FELT THAT A SOLUTION
TO THE SALVADORAN PROBLEM COULD NOT EXCLUDE THE PEOPLE'S INCLUSION OF
THE FMLN.  THE ASSASSINS WHO ACTED UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE CURFEW
ARE FROM THE SALVADORAN ARMY, THEY ARE NOT UNIDENTIFIED TERRORISTS,
LIKE THE AP CABLE SAYS.  THEY ARE ASSASSINS OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY,
THE SAME ARMY WHICH HAS ALL THE SUPPORT OF THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT.  IN
THIS, WE CAN ALSO SEE THE DOUBLE STANDARD OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION.
ON THE ONE HAND, ALL ITS PUBLICITY APPARATUS SAYS TO THE WORLD THAT
WASHINGTON IS IN FAVOR OF DEMOCRACY AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS.
HOWEVER, IN PRACTICE, IT SUPPORTS THE ASSASSINS OF PRIESTS AND
SUPPLIES BOMBS AND ROCKETS SO THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMY -- WHICH HAS
PLANES AND HELICOPTERS PROVIDED BY THE UNITED STATES -- CAN BOMB THE
SALVADORAN CIVILIAN POPULATION.

   THESE ARE THE FACTS.  THIS IS THE TRUTH THAT YANKEE PROPAGANDA IS
HIDING AND MANIPULATING.

   CLANDESTINE, 17 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] THIS MORNING, AND
WITH A STUPID LOOK ON HIS FACE, U.S.  AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER ASKED WHO
HAD KILLED FATHER IGNACIO ELLACURIA.  HE SAID HE DID NOT KNOW WHO HAD DONE
THIS.  WELL THEN, MR WILLIAM WALKER, AND MONITORS AT THE U.S. EMBASSY, GOOD
MORNING; RADIO VENCEREMOS GREETS YOU.  WE ARE ASKING YOU TO TAKE DOWN WHAT
WE ARE GOING TO SAY AND TAKE IT IMMEDIATELY TO WILLIAM WALKER'S OFFICE.

   GOOD MORNING U.S. EMBASSY MONITORS, TELL WILLIAM WALTER -- WE DO
NOT KNOW IF HE IS FROM TENNESSEE LIKE THE OTHER FILIBUSTER -- THAT
RADIO VENCEREMOS IS GIVING HIM A CLUE SO THAT HE CAN FIND OUT WHO
KILLED FATHER ELLACURIA.  TELL WILLIAM WALKLER TO FIND OUT WHO
ARRESTED TWO PRIESTS AND SEVERAL MISSIONARIES, INCLUDING A U.S.
CITIZEN THIS MORNING.

   AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER, THIS MORNING YOU ASKED WHO HAD MURDERED
FATHER IGNACIO ELLACURIA; RADIO VENCEREMOS WILL GIVE YOU A CLUE.  FIND
OUT WHO ORDERED THIS MORNING'S ARREST OF TWO PRIESTS.  U.S.
AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER, IF YOU HAVE A DROP OF DECENCY LEFT IN YOU,
SPEAK UP, SAY WHAT YOU KNOW.  TELL US WHERE THE 40 MEN IN UNIFORM LEFT
FROM.  U.S. AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER FROM TENNESSEE, THAT IS, IF YOU
ARE FROM TENNESSEE LIKE THE OTHER FILIBUSTER -- RADIO VENCEREMOS IS
GIVING YOU A CLUE SO THAT YOU WILL FIND AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION YOU
CANDIDLY ASKED ON TELEVISION THIS MORNING.  YOU SAID THAT YOU DID NOT
KNOW WHO HAD ORDERED THE DEATH OF ONE OF THE MOST INTELLIGENT MEN IN
EL SALVADOR, NOT BORN IN EL SALVADOR BUT MORE SALVADORAN THAN COLONEL
RENE EMILIO PONCE.

   WE REPEAT, MR AMBASSADOR TO EL SALVADOR, THE FOLLOWING IS OUR CLUE:
FIND OUT WHO ORDERED THE ARREST OF THE PRIESTS AND MISSIONARIES,
INCLUDING A U.S. CITIZEN.  FIND OUT IMMEDIATELY, AND YOU BETTER MOVE
QUICKLY, OTHERWISE THEY COULD BE KILLED.  THERE LIES YOUR ANSWER.  ASK
WHETHER THE TWO PRIESTS WERE ARRESTED BY THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] OR THE ARMED FORCES.  WE INSIST, IF
THERE IS A SINGLE DROP OF DECENCY LEFT IN YOU, CHECK THE ELENA FUENTES
STATEMENTS AGAINST THE CHURCH MONITORED A FEW DAYS AGO.

   MR AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER, IF THERE IS A SINGLE DROP OF DECENCY
LEFT IN YOU, CHECK THE RECORDINGS THE U.S. EMBASSY HAS OF RADIO
CUSCATLAN AND LISTEN TO WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT FATHER IGNACIO ELLACURIA,
MSGR RIVERA Y DAMAS, AND MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ ON THE NIGHT OF 11
NOVEMBER AND EARLIER.

   GENTLEMEN AT THE U.S. EMBASSY WHO ARE MONITORING US, HELP THE
AMBASSADOR.  GO TO YOUR FILES, FIND THE RADIO CUSCATLAN RECORDINGS AND
TAKE THEM TO THE AMBASSADOR'S OFFICE.  MONITORS AT THE EMBASSY, HELP
THAT ABSENTMINDED AMBASSADOR.  MONITORS AT THE EMBASSY, GIVE HIM A
HAND; IT SEEM THAT THE AMBASSADOR'S MEMORY IS FAILING HIM.  MONITORS,
YOU WHO ARE SO EFFICIENT, WE ASK YOU TO HELP THE AMBASSADOR REGAIN HIS
MEMORY.  TAKE HIM COL ELENA FUENTE'S RECORDING ACCUSING THE CHURCH OF
HAVING TIES WITH THE FMLN.  TAKE HIM COL MONTANO'S STATEMENTS, TAKE
HIM COL ZEPEDA'S STATEMENTS, TAKE HIM ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON'S
STATEMENTS, ACCUSING FATHER IGNACIO ELLACURIA OF BEING THE DIRECTOR OF
THE WAR IN EL SALVADOR.  HELP US U.S. EMBASSY MONITORS BECAUSE IT
SEEMS THAT MR WILLIAM WALKER HAS A VERY SHORT MEMORY.

   SAN SALVADOR, 17 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] ACCORDING TO REPORTS
RECEIVED IN THIS NATIONAL RADIO-TELEVISION NETWORK, BRITISH NEWSMAN DAVID
BLUNDY OF THE SUNDAY TIMES [AS HEARD] BECAME A VICTIM OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN, BULLETS.  HE DIED A FEW MINUTES AGO AT
ROSALES HOSPITAL. THE FMLN TERRORISTS DO NOT SATISFY THEIR INSTINCTS BY
KILLING CIVILIANS AND THE UCA [CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY] JESUITS, NOW
THEY ARE AIMING THEIR CRIMINAL MACHINEGUNS AT JOURNALISTS.

   THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE PEOPLE, TOGETHER WITH THE
GLORIOUS ARMED FORCES, REPEAT THEIR CALL TO THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY TO REPUDIATE THE FMLN ASSASSINS.

   THE CIVILIANS WHO GAVE BLUNDY FIRST AID HAVE TOLD US THAT THE
NEWSMAN WAS HIT BY AN FMLN SNIPER WHEN HE WAS GREETING AN OFFICER OF
OUR GLORIOUS ARMED FORCES IN MEJICANOS.

   THIS ACTION ONCE MORE CONFIRMS THE TREACHEROUS AND FLAGRANT HUMAN
RIGHTS VIOLATIONS OF THE FMLN ASSASSINS, WHO ARE BEING REPUDIATED BY
THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN)] REFERRED TO THE
BOMBINGS AND THE KILLING OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS.  THIS IS THE QUESTION
HE WAS ASKED: IN THE PAST FEW HOURS, SEVERAL GOVERNMENTS AND
HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS HAVE PRESSURED THE GOVERNMENT TO STOP THE
BOMBINGS AND THE BLOODSHED IN OUR HOMELAND.  HOWEVER, DESPITE THIS
INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE, THE JESUIT PRIESTS WERE KILLED IN SAN
SALVADOR.  THEREFORE, WHAT IS THE INTENTION BEHIND THE BOMBINGS?  WHAT
INTENTION DID THE ARMED FORCES' GENERAL STAFF HAVE IN KILLING THE
JESUITS?  COMMANDER VILLALOBOS REPLIED:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [VILLALOBOS] FIRST, IT MUST BE SAID THAT THE
KILLING OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS BY THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT WAS A HARSH
BLOW TO THE POSSIBILITIES FOR AN EFFECTIVE DEMOCRACY IN OUR COUNTRY.
THE JESUIT PRIESTS ARE A SECTOR OF SALVADORAN SOCIETY THAT HAS MADE
AND CONTINUES TO MAKE GREAT CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PEOPLE'S EDUCATION.
THEY TAUGHT US HOW TO DEBATE, THE NEED TO REASON THINGS OUT, AND THE
NEED TO HAVE POLITICAL PLURALISM.

   HOWEVER, IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES, THE [WORD
INDISTINCT] SECTORS, AND MR. CRISTIANI CANNOT STAND INTELLIGENT
PEOPLE, THE DEBATES, THE ANALYSES, AND THE PEOPLE'S REASONING.  THIS
IS WHY THEY COMMITTED THIS CRIME.

   THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS CRIME BECOMES EVIDENT, NOT ONLY BASED
ON DIRECT CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS THE FACT THAT IT WAS CARRIED OUT BY
UNIFORMED MEN DURING THE CURFEW PERIOD AND THAT A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE
CRIME A GROUP OF MILITARY MEN CHECKED OUT THE PLACE WHERE THEY WERE
GOING TO COMMIT THE CRIME -- CLEARLY INTENDING TO PREPARE A PLAN --
BUT BECAUSE OF ACCUSATIONS AGAINST THE JESUITS MADE OVER THE NATIONAL
NETWORK.  WE MUST ALSO BEAR IN MIND THAT THIS CRIME WAS A POLITICAL
MISTAKE MADE BY THE DICTATORSHIP.  IT WAS A MISCALCULATION ON THE PART
OF THOSE WHO MADE THAT DECISION.

   WE HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THAT THE ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO
STOP THE FMLN.  THEY COULD NOT STOP THE FMLN PLAN.  ONCE WE BEGAN TO
IMPLEMENT THE PLAN [1-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION] A VERY CRITICAL
SITUATION.

   WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THIS CRITICAL SITUATION, THEY TOOK THE
WRONG STEP.  THE DAY BEFORE THE CRIME THE ARMED FORCES BEGAN A
STRATEGY TO WEAR OUT THE FMLN, LOGISTICALLY.  WE MUST NOT IGNORE THE
FACT THAT THE ARMED FORCES' CALCULATIONS WERE BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION
THAT THE FMLN FORCES WOULD BECOME EXHAUSTED.  WE WOULD HAVE MADE A
SERIOUS MISTAKE IF WE HAD BEGUN THIS PLAN WITHOUT FORESEEING ALL THESE
CIRCUMSTANCES.  HOWEVER, THE ARMED FORCES BASED THEIR CALCULATIONS ON
OUR POSSIBLE EXHAUSTION.

   CONSEQUENTLY, BASED ON THOSE CALCULATIONS, THEY FIGURED THAT THEY
HAD 3 OR 4 DAYS TO LAUNCH A COUNTERATTACK.  SO, THE DAY PRIOR TO THE
KILLING OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THEY LAUNCHED SEVERAL OFFENSIVES -- I
RATHER CALL THEM COUNTEROFFENSIVES -- TO TRY TO DISLODGE US FROM OUR
POSITIONS.  THEIR TACTIC WAS TO MAKE US WASTE AMMUNITION.  THEY WERE
NOT REALLY TRYING TO MAKE US ABANDON OUR POSITIONS YET.

   HOWEVER, OUR FIGHTERS, IN ADDITION TO SAVING OUR AMMUNITION, HAVE
THE MATERIAL AND HUMAN RESOURCES SO THEY INFLICTED MANY CASUALTIES ON
THE ARMED FORCES AND WORE THEM OUT.  BUT IT SEEMS THAT THE ARMED
FORCES DID NOT REALIZE THAT AND FELT THAT THEY COULD LAUNCH A BIG
COUNTERATTACK TO ANNIHILATE THE FMLN FORCES.  BASED ON THAT, THEY CAME
UP WITH A PLAN THAT WAS NOT ONLY MILITARY BUT POLITICAL.  [WORDS
INDISTINCT] THE U.S. AMBASSADOR, THE U.S. ADVISERS, THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION, AND WHO KNOWS WHO ELSE WERE INFORMED ABOUT THIS PLAN.
THEY MADE THE WRONG INTERPRETATION OF THE CALLS MADE BY THE
INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS AND OTHER HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS ON THE
NEED TO HAVE A TRUCE TO EVACUATE CIVILIANS.  THEY THOUGHT THAT WE MADE
THESE CALLS AND BASED ON THAT, THEY FELT THAT THEY COULD PROCEED TO A
COUNTEROFFENSIVE.

   BASED ON THAT, LET US ANALYZE THE PROPAGANDA AND INFORMATION
DISSEMINATED ON THE DAY PRIOR TO THE KILLING OF THE JESUITS.  THE U.S.
AMBASSADOR HIMSELF EXPLAINED A WAR REPORT AND GAVE AN UPDATE ON THE
SITUATION.  THUS, THEY THOUGHT THAT THE FMLN WAS GOING TO SUFFER A
GREAT POLITICAL AND MILITARY DEFEAT IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS.  THEY HAD
AN OVERALL PLAN.  [CONTINUED]

DEV-MUC3-0781 (PRC)

   CLANDESTINE, 17 NOV 89 -- [INTERVIEW WITH VILLALOBOS, MEMBER OF THE
GENERAL COMMAND OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
(FMLN) BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [VILLALOBOS]
[WORDS INDISTINCT] THE ARMY CARRIED OUT A LARGE BOMB ATTACK ON
NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR IN AN EFFORT TO WEAKEN OUR POSITIONS.  [WORDS
INDISTINCT] THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE A VICTORY THERE.  BUT
IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT, ASIDE FROM ALL THE PROPAGANDA THEY USED AND
THE PLAN TO WEAKEN US MILITARILY, THE ARMED FORCES ATTACKED UNION
OFFICES AND THE HOMES OF LEADERS OF POPULAR MOVEMENTS IN VARIOUS
SECTORS.  APPARENTLY, EVERYONE HAD GONE INTO HIDING AND THEY ONLY
FOUND THE WIFE OF A UNIVERSITY LEADER AND THEY KILLED HER.  THEY ALSO
FOUND THE JESUITS.  IT SEEMS THAT IN VIEW OF RECENT TALKS WITH
CRISTIANI, FATHER ELLACURIA HAD BECOME VERY TRUSTING.  HE THOUGHT THAT
NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN TO THEM.  [30-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION] THIS
SITUATION SO THEY DID NOT PROTECT THEMSELVES IN THE FACE OF THE DANGER
OF A POSSIBLE ACTION SUCH AS THIS CRIME.

   ON THE SAME NIGHT WHEN THE ENTIRE NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR AREA WAS
BEING BOMBED, THE JESUITS WERE KILLED.  WHAT WAS THEIR INTENTION?
THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE TO OBTAIN A MILITARY VICTORY AND SET OUT TO
CARRY OUT A WITCH HUNT.  THEY SET OUT TO KILL ALL OPPOSITION MEMBERS
THAT ONE NIGHT, WITH THE IDEA THAT THEY WERE GOING TO WIPE OUT THE
FMLN, MILITARILY.  BASED ON THAT ASSUMPTION, THEY DECIDED TO CARRY OUT
THIS ACTION TO GUARANTEE FOR THEMSELVES A FEW MORE YEARS OF STABILITY
THROUGH THE PEACE OF CEMETERIES, REGARDLESS OF THE CONSEQUENCES.

   WHAT REALLY HAPPENED?  THE DAY AFTER THEY COMMITTED THE CRIME, THEY
LAUNCHED THEIR OFFENSIVE TO ANNIHILATE THE FMLN.  THEY THOUGHT THIS
WAS GOING TO BE THEIR DECISIVE DAY, BUT THE OFFENSIVE FAILED.  THEIR
ATTACK WAS REPELLED, THEY SUSTAINED MANY CASUALTIES, AND LOSS MUCH
MATERIEL.  THEIR TROOPS WERE FURTHER BEATEN AND THEY DID NOT OBTAIN
ANY EFFECTIVE MILITARY RESULTS.

   CONSEQUENTLY, THEIR COUNTEROFFENSIVE WAS REJECTED AND THE BLOW THEY
THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO DEAL TO THE LEADERS OF THE POPULAR MOVEMENT
FAILED, ON THE ONE HAND BECAUSE SOME OF THESE LEADERS WERE HIDING AND
ON THE OTHER BECAUSE THEY COMMITTED AN HORRENDOUS CRIME AND IT
BACKFIRED.  IT WAS A CRIME [WORD INDISTINCT] BY THE GENERAL STAFF AND
MR. CRISTIANI KNEW ABOUT IT.  CRISTIANI CLEARLY [WORDS INDISTINCT] AND
PROBABLY EVEN THE U.S. EMBASSY COULD BE INVOLVED IN THIS.  THEY
THOUGHT THAT BY KILLING ALL OPPOSITION MEMBERS, THEY WERE GOING TO
ACHIEVE DEFINITE PEACE IN EL SALVADOR.  THIS IS VERY CLEAR.  BUT THIS
ACTION BACKFIRED.  IT WAS A PAINFUL INCIDENT, BUT IT IS AN INCIDENT
THAT IS GOING TO BACKFIRE FOR THE GOVERNMENT.  IT IS GOING TO RESULT
IN GREAT ISOLATION FOR THE REGIME, AT A MOMENT WHEN THE FMLN IS
STRONGER.  AT A MOMENT WHEN THE FMLN HAS A POLITICAL, MILITARY, AND
STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE.

   THE MURDER OF THE JESUITS IS SUICIDE FOR THE REGIME.  I REALLY DO
NOT UNDERSTAND IT.  THEY MADE A VERY SERIOUS MISTAKE.  IN ADDITION,
THEY CONFIRMED A TRUTH WE HAVE BEEN MAINTAINING: THEY ARE FASCISTS AND
ASSASSINS.  THEY MUST LEAVE POWER.  THEY HAVE CREATED A SITUATION IN
WHICH THE POSSIBILITY FOR AN FMLN VICTORY IS GREAT.  THEY HAVE CREATED
A SITUATION IN WHICH THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE MOST CONSERVATIVE
OLIGARCHIC SECTORS OF THE SALVADORAN SOCIETY WILL BE CAUSED BY THEIR
OWN MISTAKES.  [END RECORDING]

DEV-MUC3-0782 (PRC)

   SAN SALVADOR, 17 NOV 89 (INTERPRESS AGENCY [IPS]) -- [TEXT] THE
SALVADORAN OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTIES AND THE PEOPLE'S ORGANIZATIONS
TODAY PROPOSED THE CREATION OF A SALVATION JUNTA THAT WOULD INCLUDE
THE ARMY AND THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT],
HUMBERTO CENTENO -- LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION NATIONAL UNION OF
SALVADORAN WORKERS [UNTS] -- HAS ANNOUNCED.  IN STATEMENTS TO IPS,
CENTENO SAID THE FMLN HAS ALREADY SAID IT IS WILLING TO JOIN THE
COUNTRY'S POLITICAL LIFE, AND THAT IT IS WILLING TO BE A PART OF A
SALVATION JUNTA AS A SOLUTION TO THE NATIONAL CRISIS.

   THE UNTS' PROPOSAL WAS SUPPORTED BY FIDEL CHAVEZ MENA, CHRISTIAN
DEMOCRATIC PARTY [PDC] NATIONAL SECRETARY AND PRESIDENT OF THE LATIN
AMERICAN CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC ORGANIZATION, IN STATEMENTS TO THE
PRESS.  CHAVEZ MENA, WHO WAS THE PDC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN THE
PAST ELECTIONS, SAID THAT ONE OF THE WAYS TO SOLVE THE CIVIL WAR
PROBLEM WOULD BE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO RECTIFY ITS STAND AND INITIATE
NEW NEGOTIATIONS.  WE SHOULD ALL SIT DOWN TO FIND A SOLUTION, HE TOLD
NEWSMEN, ADDING THAT NEITHER SIDE WILL ACHIEVE A MILITARY VICTORY.

   MEANWHILE, CENTENO STATED THAT THE BOMBINGS IN DENSELY POPULATED
AREAS AND THE MURDER OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS ARE FACTORS THAT ARE
WEARING OUT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND.
ACCORDING TO THE LABOR LEADER, NONE OF THE SOCIAL FORCES WITH ANY
REPRESENTATIVE FORCE SUPPORT ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND HIS GOVERNMENT.

   ALTHOUGH THERE IS NOT A GENERAL CONSENSUS, THE POLITICAL AND LABOR
GROUPS HAVE SAID THEY ARE IN FAVOR OF A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION AND THE
RESUMPTION OF A DIALOGUE WITH THE PRESENCE OF THE OAS AND THE UNITED
NATIONS AS WELL AS THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AS GUARANTORS OF
THE AGREEMENTS.  HOWEVER, THE PETITION MIGHT NOT BE RECEIVED WELL BY A
GOVERNMENT THAT IS APPARENTLY NOT WILLING TO NEGOTIATE A CEASE-FIRE
WITH THE REBELS WHO CONTINUE OCCUPYING THE NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE
NORTHERN AREA OF THE CAPITAL CITY.

   CLANDESTINE, 17 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [STATEMENT]
[GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY GENERAL COMMAND] [TEXT] WE
CONDEMN GUATEMALAN INTERFERENCE IN EL SALVADOR.

   THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY [URNG] GENERAL COMMAND
EXPRESSES ITS PROFOUND SOLIDARITY AND ADMIRATION FOR THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE AND THEIR VANGUARD FORCES, THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT], WHO WITH GREAT HEROISM AND DETERMINATION,
ARE WRITING ONE OF THE MOST GLORIOUS PAGES IN SALVADORAN HISTORY.

   WITH DEEP INDIGNATION, WE HAVE SEEN HOW THE MEMBERS OF LA TANDONA,
[MEMBERS OF THE 1966 GRADUATING CLASS OF THE CAPTAIN GERARDO BARRIOS
MILITARY ACADEMY] AND THE ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] GOVERNMENT
HEADED BY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI HAVE DECIDED TO CONDUCT AND MAINTAIN MASSIVE
BOMBINGS AGAINST THE DEFENSELESS CIVILIAN POPULATION, THUS SOWING DEATH,
SLAUGHTERING, AND DESTROYING, IN VIEW OF THEIR INABILITY TO DEFEAT,
DISLODGE, OR CONTAIN THE HEROIC FMLN FIGHTERS.

   CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT AND THE SALVADORAN ARMY HAVE LOST CONTROL
OVER THEIR ACTIONS BECAUSE OF THEIR DESPERATION OVER THE FMLN'S
VICTORIOUS ADVANCE.  THE FMLN FORCES HAVE NOT ONLY MAINTAINED THEIR
POSITIONS, BUT HAVE ALSO INCREASED THEM IN SAN SALVADOR AND THROUGHOUT
THE REMAINING SALVADORAN TERRITORY.

   ACTING OUT OF REVENGE, CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT AND THE SALVADORAN
ARMY BEGAN A SERIES OF CRIMINAL ACTIONS AIMED AT ALL THOSE WHO HAVE
IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES WITH THE FAIR CAUSES OF THE SALVADORAN MAJORITY.
AS A RESULT, EARLY ON THE MORNING OF 16 NOVEMBER, SIX JESUIT PRIESTS
AND TWO HUMBLE WOMEN WHO WORKED WITH THEM WERE BRUTALLY MURDERED.

   WE SHARE THE ENORMOUS PAIN OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THAT OF THE
JESUIT COMMUNITIES.  WE ADD OUR PROTEST TO THE VOICES OF ALL THOSE WHO
HAVE PROTESTED AGAINST SUCH A VILE MURDER.

   THE URNG GENERAL COMMAND VIGOROUSLY CONDEMNS THOSE ACTIONS AND
CALLS ON THE GUATEMALAN PEOPLE AND ON ALL POLITICAL, SOCIAL,
DEMOCRATIC, AND RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES AGAINST
THOSE BARBARIC AND GENOCIDAL ACTIONS, WHICH CAN ONLY BE COMPARED TO
THE ACTIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE UNITED STATES IN VIETNAM AND THE NAZIS
DURING WORLD WAR II.

   IN OUR STATEMENT ISSUED ON 13 NOVEMBER, WE REPORTED THE
INTERVENTIONIST PLANS OF THE GUATEMALAN ARMY AGAINST OUR FRATERNAL
NATION, EL SALVADOR.  ACCORDING TO REPORTS RELEASED BY PRESS AGENCIES
ON 15 NOVEMBER, 126 GUATEMALAN ARMY MEN BELONGING TO SPECIAL TROOPS
CALLED SAIBILES, WHO CHARACTERIZED THEMSELVES FOR THEIR PATHOLOGIC
SAVAGERY, WERE DEPLOYED.  [SENTENCE AS HEARD] PRESIDENT CEREZO, THE
CHIEF OF THE GUATEMALAN GENERAL STAFF, AND THE GUATEMALAN ARMY
OFFICIAL SPOKESMAN HAVE ALREADY PUBLICLY EXPRESSED THEIR SOLIDARITY
AND SUPPORT FOR CRISTIANI.

   WE VIGOROUSLY CONDEMN THE INTERFERENCE OF THE GUATEMALAN ARMY
AGAINST THE GLORIOUS SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  WE CALL ON ALL GUATEMALAN
GROUPS TO PROTEST THAT INTERFERENCE.  WE WILL MAKE THE GUATEMALAN
GOVERNMENT AND ARMY PAY A VERY HIGH PRICE FOR THIS AGGRESSION AGAINST
THE FRATERNAL SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   WE WARN THE WORLD THAT A GENOCIDE LARGER THAN THE ONE WHICH HAS
ALREADY OCCURRED IS BEING CONDUCTED IN EL SALVADOR NOW.  WE ARE SURE
THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WILL DEFEAT ALL THEIR ENEMIES; THAT THEY WILL BE
THE WINNERS OF THIS HISTORIC STRUGGLE, AND THAT THEY WILL ACHIEVE
THEIR GOALS.

   THE BLOOD THAT HAS BEEN SHED WILL TURN INTO NEW LIFE.  THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS OF FREEDOM,
DEMOCRACY, AND PEACE.

   SAN SALVADOR, 17 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [STATEMENT]
[SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI] [TEXT] SALVADORAN PEOPLE: WE
HAVE POWERFUL REASONS FOR ENSURING THAT JUSTICE WILL BE SERVED IN THIS
REGRETTABLE INCIDENT IN WHICH FATHER ELLACURIA, OTHER PRIESTS, AND
CIVILIANS WERE KILLED.  WE WANT TO TELL THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO DRAW
PREMATURE CONCLUSIONS TO ABSTAIN FROM DOING SO; WE URGE YOU TO HEED
THE COMMUNITY OF JESUS AND THE ARCHBISHOPRIC OF SAN SALVADOR'S CALLS
THAT THIS CASE NOT BE POLITICIZED OR USED TO GENERATE FURTHER VIOLENCE
IN THE COUNTRY.

   WE BELIEVE THAT AN INVESTIGATION MUST BE CONDUCTED; WE ARE
COMMITTED TO CONDUCTING AN IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION TO PUNISH THE
PERPETRATORS OF THIS SAVAGE ACTION REGARDLESS OF WHO IS INVOLVED.  THE
ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC WILL
REQUEST HELP TO ENSURE THAT THE SALVADORAN CRIME INVESTIGATION
COMMISSION WILL BE ADVISED BY EXPERTS IN ORDER TO GET TO THE ROOT OF
THIS REGRETTABLE INCIDENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  WE WILL ASK THE UNITED
STATES, GREAT BRITAIN, AND SPAIN TO HELP US.  I MENTION SPAIN BECAUSE
SOME OF THOSE WHO WERE ASSASSINATED ARE CITIZENS OF THAT COUNTRY.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE: WE BELIEVE THAT THE TIME HAS COME TO CONDUCT AN
INVESTIGATION AND ENSURE THAT JUSTICE IS SERVED IN REPREHENSIBLE
ACTIONS LIKE THIS ONE INSTEAD OF POLITICIZING THEM AND GENERATING
FURTHER VIOLENCE.

   THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND THE ARMED FORCES WILL NEVER
ALLOW A RETURN TO THE PAST; A RETURN TO THOSE DRAMATIC AND REGRETTABLE
TIMES IN THE COUNTRY WHEN GROUPS WANTED TO FUTHER THEIR CAUSE THROUGH
VIOLENT ACTS SUCH AS THIS ONE.  WE WILL NOT ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN AND
WILL PURSUE SUCH GROUPS TO ENSURE THAT THEY FEEL THE FULL FORCE OF THE
LAW.

   CLANDESTINE, 17 NOV 89 (CADENA REVOLUCIONARIA NACIONAL) -- [REPORT]
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GENERAL COMMAND] [TEXT] ON
THE 7TH DAY OF THE OFFENSIVE, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT [FMLN] HAS TAKEN A STRATEGIC TURN IN THE WAR, AS WE BEGIN TO
STRUGGLE FOR POWER IN A NEW AND DEFINITE SCENARIO OF OPERATIONS IN THE
CITIES, WITH THE INSURRECTIONAL PARTICIPATION OF THE PEOPLE SEEKING TO
ACHIEVE PEACE AND DEMOCRACY.  THE FIGHTING WAGED IN SAN SALVADOR, SAN
MIGUEL, USULUTAN, ZACATECOLUCA, SANTA ANA, AND OTHER PARTS IN THE
COUNTRY HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE THANKS TO THE LEADING ROLE PLAYED BY THE
PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUPPORTED AND JOINED THE STRUGGLE.

   THE 7 DAYS OF OUR OFFENSIVE HAVE EXPOSED THE MILITARY FASCIST
DICTATORSHIP TO THE EYES OF THE WORLD.  THE DICTATORSHIP HAS REMOVED
ITS CIVILIAN MASK, AND IT HAS SHOWN ITS BARBARIC NATURE AS IT BOMBED
CITIES AND MURDERED JESUIT PRIESTS, WHO WERE MEMBERS OF A NATIONAL
CONSCIENCE THAT IS SEEKING SOCIAL CHANGES AND PEACE IN EL SALVADOR.

   THESE CRIMES COMMITTED BY CRISTIANI AND COLONEL PONCE [CHAIRMAN OF
THE ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF] DEFINITELY ISOLATE
THEM FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD, WHICH CONDEMNS THEM AND RECALLS THE
LAST DAYS OF SOMOZA.  IN THE MEANTIME, THE U.S.  CONGRESS DISCUSSES
CUTTING MILITARY AID TO THE REGIME.  THE 7 DAYS OF OUR OFFENSIVE HAVE
LED TO IRREVERSIBLE ACHIEVEMENTS.  THE REGIME HAS BEEN DEFEATED IN THE
POLITICAL FIELD AND FATALY WOUNDED IN THE MILITARY FIELD.

   IN 7 DAYS OF COMBAT IN THE CAPITAL CITY, THE HIGH COMMAND LOST ITS
LAST DEFENSIVE LINE.  OUR FORCES ARE HITTING HARD AT THEIR TIRED
HEART.  VICTORY IS A FACT THAT NO ONE CAN ALTER.

   IN THE OFFENSIVE, WE KILLED OR WOUNDED AN ESTIMATED 827 TROOPS AND
OFFICERS.  WE SEIZED 127 LONG WEAPONS, 21 MACHINEGUNS AND SUPPORT
WEAPONS, AS WELL AS ABOUT 80,000 ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION OF VARIOUS
CALIBERS.  WE HAVE CONFIRMED REPORTS THAT WE HAVE DAMAGED 11 AIRCRAFT
AND DESTROYED 27 ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS.

   THE HUMILIATING DEFEAT OF THE HIGH COMMAND IS EVIDENT IN A
DEPRESSED COL PONCE, WHO NO LONGER SPEAKS OF THE GUERRILLAS IN POCKETS
ALONG THE BORDER.  INSTEAD, HE SPEAKS IN FRONT OF A MAP OF THE CAPITAL
CITY, POINTING OUT THE PRESENCE AND ADVANCE OF THE FMLN.

   VARIOUS POLITICAL AND SOCIAL GROUPS OF EL SALVADOR HAVE INITIATED
EFFORTS ON THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL TO ACHIEVE A CONSENSUS IN ORDER TO
FORM A NEW GOVERNMENT THAT WILL PUT AN END TO THE WAR AND BRING ABOUT
THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF THE COUNTRY.  THE FMLN LOOKS FAVORABLY ON THESE
EFFORTS, AND IT HAS ALREADY ACTIVELY JOINED THESE NATIONAL SECTORS WHO
ARE OPPOSED TO THE GENOCIDE BEING CARRIED OUT BY THE HIGH COMMAND IN A
SUICIDAL ATTEMPT TO PRESERVE THE WAR THAT IT HAS TURNED INTO A
BUSINESS DEAL.

   THE GENERAL COMMAND RECOGNIZES THE HEROISM OF OUR FIGHTERS AND
CALLS ON THEM TO CONTINUE ADVANCING ALONG WITH OUR REBELS IN THE FINAL
CHAPTER OF THIS HISTORY.

   [SIGNED] THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND, 17 NOVEMBER 1989

DEV-MUC3-0788 (PRC)

   PANAMA CITY (PANAMA), 17 NOV 89 (LA REPUBLICA) -- [TEXT] PRD [DEMOCRATIC
REVOLUTIONARY PARTY] COMMUNIQUE:

   TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE LATIN AMERICAN CHURCH MET IN MEDELLIN AND
DECIDED TO WORK FOR THE NEEDY, DEATH SQUADS IN EL SALVADOR HAVE
MURDERED IGNACIO ELLACURIA, A PRIEST, TEACHER, AND A SOCIAL FIGHTER,
ALONG WITH SEVEN OTHER PRIESTS AND FAITHFUL.  A WAR THAT BEGAN WITH
THE MARTYRDOM OF ARCHBISHOP OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO IS NOW TAKING THE
LIVES OF HUNDREDS OF VICTIMS WHO ARE KILLED IN INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS
AND ATTACKS ON THE POPULATION.

   THE CRIME COMMITTED TODAY WAS SPONSORED BY THE SAME ONES WHO ARE
NOW PLANNING GENERAL MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA'S MURDER.  THERE IS ONLY A
DIFFERENCE OF TIME AND PLACE.  INSTEAD OF BOMBING DENSELY POPULATED
NEIGHBORHOODS, THESE PEOPLE ARE RESORTING TO ATTACKS ON CERTAIN
FIGURES AND LEADERS.

   BECAUSE OF THE ENORMOUS SIZE OF THE LATIN AMERICAN CRISIS, IT IS
EVIDENT THAT THE CHURCH CANNOT ESCAPE THE DEMAND THAT MODERN TIMES
IMPOSE ON ALL GROUPS OF DECIDING WHETHER TO BE ON THE SIDE OF
PATRIOTIC AND LIBERTARIAN CAUSES OR TO BECOME ACCOMPLICES OF LOCAL AND
FOREIGN OPPRESSORS.

   LIKE MSGR ROMERO, FATHER ELLACURIA AND HIS COMPANIONS IN MARTYRDOM
REPRESENT THE CHURCH THAT IS BORN FROM THE HOMELAND AND THAT STRUGGLES
ALONG WITH THE PEOPLE.  PANAMANIAN GENERAL OMAR TORRIJOS ALSO DECIDED
TO WORK ALONG WITH THE PEOPLE FROM INSIDE THE ARMED FORCES.  THESE
MARTYRS DESERVE THE SAME SOLIDARITY THEY GAVE TO THE LATIN AMERICAN
CAUSE OF NATIONAL LIBERATION, BECAUSE THEY CHALLENGED THE OLIGARCHY,
IMPERIALISM, AND EVEN THE REACTIONARY GROUPS OF THEIR OWN CHURCH.

   NOW, WHEN ALL THE WEIGHT OF THE LATIN AMERICAN CRISIS AND FOREIGN
AGGRESSION FALLS UPON THE SALVADORAN AND PANAMANIAN PEOPLES; NOW THAT
THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE MASSIVELY REPRESSED; AND NOW THAT THE
GOVERNMENT IN WASHINGTON ORDERS THE CIA TO ATTACK GEN NORIEGA, THOSE
WHO STRUGGLE IN EL SALVADOR AND THOSE WHO PATRIOTICALLY RESIST ARE IN
FACT DOING SO FOR ALL OF LATIN AMERICA.

   THUS, IGNACIO ELLACURIA'S AND HIS PARTNERS' SACRIFICE, AS WELL AS
THE PREVIOUS SACRIFICE OF MSGR ROMERO AND THAT OF GEN NORIEGA, WILL
BEAR FRUITS OF LIBERATION, JUSTICE, AND SOVEREIGNTY.

   THESE FRUITS WILL BE PLENTIFUL AND MORE DELICIOUS IF ALL THOSE WHO
HAVE BEEN NEXT TO AND LEARNED FROM THESE PEOPLE CONTINUE STRUGGLING
WITH THEIR EXAMPLE IN MIND.  THE SACRIFICE THEY HAVE MADE FOR ALL OF
US DESERVES PRAISE AND SOLIDARITY.  WE OFFER THEM THAT PRAISE AND
SOLIDARITY BY REAFFIRMING OUR COMMITMENT TO WORK AND STRUGGLE FOR THE
DEFINITIVE LIBERATION OF OUR OWN PEOPLE.

DEV-MUC3-0804 (PRC)

   SAN SALVADOR, 18 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] INOCENTE ARIAS, THE
SPANISH UNDER FOREIGN SECRETARY, SAID TODAY THAT SALVADORAN PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI "PROMISED TO CARRY OUT A PROMPT AND SERIOUS
INVESTIGATION" AND "TO PUNISH THOSE RESPONSIBLE" FOR THE MURDER OF SIX
JESUITS AND TWO WOMEN ON 16 NOVEMBER.

   ARIAS ADDED THAT THE MEETING HELD THIS AFTERNOON WITH PRESIDENT
CRISTIANI WAS "CORDIAL AND SINCERE."

   ARIAS, WHO ARRIVED TODAY IN SAN SALVADOR ALONG WITH OTHER HIGH-RANKING
SPANISH OFFICIALS, SAID THAT "THE PRESIDENT SEEMS WILLING TO PROMOTE A
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HORRIBLE
MASSACRE."

   THE OFFICIAL DELEGATION CAME TO EL SALVADOR AFTER SIX JESUITS, FIVE
OF THEM SPANISH, WERE MURDERED BY INDIVIDUALS WEARING MILITARY
UNIFORMS.

   INOCENCIO ARIAS AFFIRMED THAT PRESIDENT CRISTIANI IS "A LUCID,
INTELLIGENT, AND WELL-INTENDED PERSON," WHO IS "APPARENTLY INTERESTED
IN CLARIFYING THE FACTS."

   AFTER MEETING WITH ARIAS, THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT EXPLAINED TO
ACAN-EFE THAT HE REQUESTED EXPERTS BE SENT FROM SPAIN, THE UNITED
STATES, AND GREAT BRITAIN.

   CRISTIANI JUSTIFIED THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGN EXPERTS "FROM SPAIN,
BECAUSE THE JESUITS WERE SPANISH; FROM THE UNITED STATES, BECAUSE THEY
REQUESTED IT; AND FROM GREAT BRITAIN, BECAUSE OF THE FAME OF SCOTLAND
YARD.

   ACCORDING TO ARIAS, PRESIDENT CRISTIANI "WAS AFFECTED BY THE DEATHS
OF THE PRIESTS."

   ARIAS SAID THAT DURING HIS VISIT TO EL SALVADOR, HE WILL ALSO TRY
TO "WORK ON THE DEPARTURE OF THOSE SPANISH WHO ARE IN GREATER DANGER
IN THE COUNTRY."

   THE OFFICIAL DECLINED BLAMING ANY GROUP FOR THE DEATH OF THE
JESUITS AND THE TWO WOMEN, BUT HE EMPHASIZED THAT PRESIDENT CRISTIANI
TOLD HIM THAT "THE REPONSIBLE PERSONS, WHOEVER THEY MAY BE, WILL BE
PUNISHED."

   THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT "THE GOVERNMENT AND THE
ARMED FORCES, AS AN INSTITUTION, ARE DETERMINED TO INVESTIGATE THE
CASE TO THE VERY END TO UNCOVER WHO COMMITTED THE CRIMES."

   WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THEY MAY BE MILITARY MEMBERS, HE
ANSWERED THAT "THE ARMED FORCES HAVE NOT RULED OUT THAT THEY MIGHT
HAVE BEEN MEMBERS OF THE ARMY, AND THEY ARE DETERMINED TO INVESTIGATE
THIS THOROUGHLY."

   HOWEVER, CRISTIANI REJECTED THE "PREMATURE INTERPRETATIONS" THAT
CLAIM THE MILITARY CARRIED OUT THE MULTIPLE CRIME.

   THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT TOLD THE SPANISH DIPLOMAT THAT THE
SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR "WILL BE PEACEFUL IN A FEW DAYS," AND HE
REITERATED THAT HE "IS WILLING TO CONTINUE WITH THE DIALOGUE."

   HOWEVER, HE TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT "WE ARE NOT GOING TO ATTEND A
MEETING THAT WILL NOT BE ATTENDED BY THE OTHER PARTY," REFERRING TO
THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE GUERRILLAS ARE NOT PLANNING TO ATTEND THE
MEETING SLATED TO START ON 20 NOVEMBER IN CARACAS, VENEZUELA.

   ACCORDING TO ARIAS, CRISTIANI INSISTS THAT THE SITUATION IS
"PRETTY MUCH CONTROLLED IN THE COUNTRY," ALTHOUGH THE SALVADORAN        
PRESIDENT WARNED THEM "THERE MIGHT BE NEW OUTBREAKS OF VIOLENCE."

   TODAY MARKS THE 8TH DAY OF THE BLOODY FIGHTING BETWEEN THE ARMY AND
THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS.  IT HAS LEFT AT LEAST 1,000 PERSONS DEAD,
HUNDREDS OF PERSONS WOUNDED, AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PERSONS
DISPLACED, WHO HAVE HAD TO LEAVE THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS AND TOWNS TO FLEE
FROM THE CROSSFIRE OF THE FIGHTERS AND THE BOMBINGS OF THE SALVADORAN
AIR FORCE.

DEV-MUC3-0811 (PRC)

   CLANDESTINE, 19 NOV 89 -- [INTERVIEW WITH FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) COMMANDER ROBERTO ROCA BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER]
[TEXT] [CONTINUED] [ROCA] REAL LIFE IS MAKING IT EVIDENT THAT IN EL
SALVADOR WE MUST FIND A DEMOCRATIC SOLUTION TO THE TERRIBLE CRISIS
BEING ENDURED -- TO THE WAR.  THIS DEMOCRATIC SOLUTION MEANS ISOLATING
AND EXCLUDING THE FASCISTS FROM POWER BECAUSE THEY ARE AGAINST
DEMOCRACY.

   MR CRISTIANI CANNOT SAY UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HE SHARES NO
RESPONSIBILITY IN THE MURDER OF THE JESUITS.  IN THE FRAMEWORK OF HIS
FRUSTRATED ATTEMPT TO STOP THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE, HE UNLEASHED THE
DOGS OF WAR -- ALL THE FASCIST ELEMENTS -- SO THAT THEY WOULD COMMIT
ALL THE OUTRAGES THEY HAVE COMMITTED.  THIS INCLUDES THE FASCIST
ELEMENTS IN THE AIR FORCE AND THEIR INDISCRIMINATE BOMBING OF THE
CIVILIAN POPULATION, AS WELL AS THE DEATH SQUADS, WHO WERE UNLEASHED
SO THEY WOULD MURDER PEOPLE WHO BEST EXPRESS THE DEMOCRATIC FEELINGS
OF THE PEOPLE AND, AS IN THE CASE OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, TO ELIMINATE
A VALUABLE SECTOR OF THE SALVADORAN INTELLIGENTSIA AT THE SERVICE OF
DEMOCRACY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE.

   AS WE ALL KNOW, THE JESUITS HAD CONTINUOUSLY DENOUNCED THE UNJUST
SYSTEM IN EL SALVADOR AND HAD CALLED FOR CLEARING UP ALL CRIMES.  THE
FASCISTS, IN THEIR HATRED, PUT AN END TO THE LIVES OF THESE JESUITS
BELIEVING THAT THEY CAN HIDE THE SUN WITH ONE FINGER.  THE INDIGNATION
OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WILL BE INCREASINGLY BACKED BY THE U.S.
PEOPLE AS A RESULT OF THEIR INDIGNATION AND BY U.S.  POLITICIANS WHO
HAVE BECOME AWARE OF THE FACT THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO PUT AN END TO
FASCIST OUTRAGES IN EL SALVADOR.  THE FASCISTS REPRESENT A BARRIER
THAT MUST BE DESTROYED AND DEFEATED TO HAVE DEMOCRACY IN EL SALVADOR.

   [REPORTER] COMMANDER, IF THE UNITED STATES DECIDED TO CUT OFF
MILITARY AND ECONOMIC AID TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT, WHAT IMPACT
WOULD THIS HAVE ON THE ARMED FORCES?

   [ROCA] WE HAVE SAID ON MANY OCCASIONS THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMED
FORCES WOULD HAVE LOST THE WAR SOME TIME AGO WERE IT NOT FOR U.S.
SUPPORT AND FINANCING.  AS WE HAVE STATED IN ALL OUR PROPOSALS FOR A
POLITICAL SOLUTION, OUR OBJECTIVE IS NEITHER THE DESTRUCTION NOR THE
ELIMINATION OF THE ARMED FORCES.  WHAT WE WANT IS FOR THE ARMED FORCES
TO GET RID OF THE FASCIST ELEMENTS THAT HAVE TURNED IT INTO A TOOL
THAT ACTS AGAINST THE PEOPLE AND DEMOCRACY.

   WE BELIEVE THAT SENSIBLE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES OFFICERS, THOSE
WHO HAVE NOT LOST THEIR HEADS, MUST TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION [WORDS
INDISTINCT] INDISCRIMINATE BOMBING, THE POLITICAL DEFEAT OF THE
CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT, AND THE MILITARY DEFEAT OF THE METHODS AND
TACTICS [WORDS INDISTINCT].  [CONTINUED]

DEV-MUC3-0814 (PRC)

   CLANDESTINE, 19 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
SALVADOR SAMAYOA, MEMBER OF THE POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC COMMISSION OF
THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT-DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTIONARY
FRONT, FMLN-FDR, BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [REPORTER] COMRADE
SALVADOR SAMAYOA, WE HAVE HEARD REPORTS ON STATEMENTS BY THE U.S.
AMBASSADOR IN SAN SALVADOR, WILLIAM WALKER, WHO SAID THAT DESPITE THE
BOMBINGS HIS GOVERNMENT, THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, WILL CONTINUE GIVING
MILITARY AID AND SUPPORT TO THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT.  HOWEVER, IT
SEEMS THE SITUATION HAS CHANGED FOLLOWING THE ASSASSINATION OF THE
JESUITS.  AT THIS MOMENT, HOW DOES THE UNITED STATES PERCEIVE THE NEW
SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR?

   [SAMAYOA] AT THE LEVEL OF THE U.S. PEOPLE, THERE IS A TOTAL
REPUDIATION OF THE FASCIST CRIMINAL GOVERNMENT AND OF THE SALVADORAN
ARMED FORCES BECAUSE OF THE BOMBINGS -- WHICH HAVE BECOME A TRUE
GENOCIDE -- IN VARIOUS DENSELY POPULATED CITIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS IN
EL SALVADOR, AS WELL AS BECAUSE OF THE ASSASSINATIONS PERPETRATED BY
THE SALVADORAN ARMY AGAINST THE JESUIT PRIESTS AT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
UNIVERSITY [UCA].  THERE HAVE BEEN VERY RADICAL DEMONSTRATIONS
EXPRESSING MUCH INDIGNATION BY VARIOUS U.S. SOCIAL SECTORS.  MOREOVER,
IN SOME OF THOSE DEMONSTRATIONS, THE POLICE BARRICADES WERE BROKEN.
IMPORTANT U.S. POLITICAL PERSONALITIES SUCH AS JESSE JACKSON, ONE OF
THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS LEADERS IN THE UNITED STATES, PARTICIPATED IN THE
DEMONSTRATIONS.  THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN DEMONSTRATIONS IN BOSTON,
CHICAGO, NEW YORK, SAN FRANCISCO, AND LOS ANGELES.  IN AT LEAST 20
CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES PEOPLE HAVE EXPRESSED ALL THEIR
REPUDIATION AND INDIGNATION OVER THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AND THE U.S.
POLICY IN EL SALVADOR.

   SINCE THE ASSASSINATION OF THE UCA PRIESTS, A LARGE NUMBER OF
IMPORTANT U.S. SENATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES ARE SAYING THAT U.S.
MILITARY AID TO THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES AND GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE
CUT AND SUSPENDED.  SENATOR KENNEDY IN PARTICULAR MADE A VERY STRONG
STATEMENT, SAYING THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES' ATTITUDE SIMPLY
EXPRESSES THE FAILURE OF 10 YEARS OF U.S. POLICY -- WHICH HAS BEEN
SPENT FEEDING, TRAINING, ARMING, AND FINANCING AN ARMED FORCE THAT
CARRIES OUT ASSASSINATIONS.  IN ADDITION TO SENATOR KENNEDY, THERE ARE
MANY U.S. SENATORS AND CONGRESSMEN WHO ARE REQUESTING THE TOTAL
SUSPENSION OF MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR.  AT THIS TIME, THE
CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES HAVE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF
REPUDIATION IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE PAST 10 YEARS.  HOWEVER, THE
U.S. GOVERNMENT, [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE STATE DEPARTMENT, AND THE
WHITE HOUSE CONTINUE SUPPORTING THE [SALVADORAN] CRIMINAL
REGIME AND GIVING IT FURTHER EMERGENCY AID.

   [REPORTER] COMRADE, YESTERDAY WE LEARNED ABOUT ARTICLES PUBLISHED
IN THE MAIN U.S. NEWSPAPERS THE NEW YORK TIMES AND THE WASHINGTON
POST, WHICH STRONGLY QUESTION THE GOVERNMENT, SPECIFICALLY PRESIDENT
CRISTIANI, THE CHIEF OF THE FASCIST DICTATORSHIP.  WHAT IS THE
SITUATION OF THE CRISTIANI SPEECH AND HIS ALLEGED LEGITIMACY, NOT ONLY
IN THE UNITED STATES BUT ALSO AT THE LEVEL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY?

   [SAMAYOA] THE ALLEGED LEGITIMACY OF CRISTIANI COLLAPSED.  IN THE
UNITED STATES, THEY SAID CRISTIANI WAS [WORDS INDISTINCT] HAD GOOD
INTENTIONS, BUT THE RIGHT-WING [WORDS INDISTINCT] AND THE DEATH SQUADS
DID NOT LET HIM WORK.  THE SPEECH FAILED BECAUSE IT IS NOW CLEAR THAT
AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES, CRISTIANI IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE GENOCIDE IN SAN SALVADOR AND OTHER DEPARTMENTS IN THE COUNTRY
[WORDS INDISTINCT].  THE MEDIA HAVE ALSO REPORTED THE ARREST OF U.S.
RELIGIOUS MEN AND OF SWISS, FRENCH, SPANISH, AND JAPANESE CITIZENS.
THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS A GOVERNMENT ACCUSING EVERYONE OF
COOPERATING WITH THE GUERRILLAS, AND THIS HAS CAUSED A TOTAL LOSS OF
THE GOVERNMENT'S PRESTIGE. EDITORIALS ON 18 NOVEMBER IN THE MAIN U.S.
NEWSPAPERS [WORDS INDISTINCT] CRISTIANI IS NOT MORE THAN [WORDS
INDISTINCT]. AT EMBASSIES AND CONSULATES IN MOST COUNTRIES IN WESTERN
EUROPE -- IN ITALY, SPAIN, THE FRG, FRANCE, SWEDEN, DENMARK AND
EVERYWHERE -- THERE HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATIONS CALLED BY LABOR UNIONS,
POLITICAL PARTIES, AND PEOPLE'S MOVEMENTS IN THOSE COUNTRIES TO
EXPRESS REPUDIATION.  IN LONDON, ONE OF THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS HUMAN
RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS, AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL, URGED EVERYONE TO STAGE
DEMONSTRATIONS IN FRONT OF ALL SALVADORAN EMBASSIES AND CONSULATES.

DEV-MUC3-0815 (PRC)

   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [INTERVIEW WITH FMLN'S
ROBERTO ROCA BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [ROCA] THE
GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE HAS NOT BEEN DEFEATED AND CANNOT BE DEFEATED.
INTERNATIONAL REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE REVOLUTIONARY FORCES HAVE
BECOME STRONG IN THE CITY, THAT THEY ARE MAKING TACTICAL MOVEMENTS,
AND THAT IN SPITE OF THE BARBARISM WITH WHICH THE ARMED FORCES HAS
BEEN OPERATING, THE GUERRILLAS MAINTAIN ALL OF THEIR OPERATIONAL
CAPABILITIES.

   THE SITUATION CANNOT DEFEAT US.  THERE MUST BE A SOLUTION, AND THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE INCREASINGLY, AND IN DIFFERENT WAYS, BECOMING
INVOLVED IN THE REVOLUTIONARY PROCESS TO DEFEAT THE FASCISTS AND THE
GENOCIDAL TACTICS THEY ARE USING.

   WE BELIEVE THAT WHAT IS HAPPENING IS HAVING AN IMPACT ON
INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION, AND THIS UNDOUBTEDLY WILL HAVE AN EFFECT
ON THE ARMED FORCES AND COULD RESULT IN AN EFFORT TO SAVE THE
INSTITUTION.

   WE BELIEVE THAT IN THE ARMED FORCES THERE ARE OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS
WHO REJECT FASCISM.  THERE HAVE BEEN MANY DESERTIONS IN THE ARMY
FILES.  MANY ORDERS ARE BEING DISOBEYED, ORDERS OF A GENOCIDAL NATURE
USUALLY.  THIS IS THE STARTING POINT OF AN EVENT THAT WILL STUN
POLITICAL OPINION IN EL SALVADOR.

   WE BELIEVE THAT IF THIS SAVAGE KILLING OF PEOPLE DOES NOT STOP, THE
MILITARY INSTITUTION WILL BE SIGNING ITS OWN DEATH SENTENCE.  THE
PEOPLE CANNOT TOLERATE A MILITARY THAT FUNCTIONS UNDER A MOST SAVAGE
AND DESPOTIC REGIME, AND THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT IS IN HOT WATER, WE
COULD SAY.

   THE REVOLUTIONARY OFFENSIVE, AS I HAVE NOTED, IS BEING DEVELOPED.
WE HAVE SOLID POSITIONS IN FOUR OF EL SALVADOR'S MAIN CITIES, AND AS
WE HAVE SAID BEFORE: NO ONE IS GOING TO PUSH US OUT.  VICTORY FOR
DEMOCRACY HAS BEEN ASSURED.  THE WORLD WILL BACK US IN THE FACE OF THE
SAVAGE GENOCIDE BY THE GOVERNMENT FORCES, ESPECIALLY BY THE FASCIST
MILITARY ELEMENTS IN EL SALVADOR.

   [REPORTER] TO CONCLUDE, COMMANDER, THE FUNERAL RITES FOR THE THE
PRIESTS WHO WERE MURDERED IN SAN SALVADOR ARE TAKING PLACE AT THIS
MOMENT, AROUND NOON TIME, AND ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND HIS WIFE ARE
ATTENDING THIS CEREMONY.  DO YOU HAVE ANY MESSAGE FOR THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE, FOR THE STUDENTS FROM THE CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY, FOR THE
CHRISTIAN PEOPLE, FOR THE PEOPLE IN GENERAL, WHO ARE MOURNING THE
DEATH OF THESE WORTHY JESUITS?

   [ROCA] WE HAVE ALREADY EXPRESSED, AND I WILL REITERATE IT NOW, THE
DEEP SORROW OF THE FMLN MILITANTS AND THE PEOPLE IN GENERAL OVER THE
LOSS OF THESE WORTHY JESUIT PRIESTS WHO HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT
STRUGGLERS FOR DEMOCRACY AND PEACE IN EL SALVADOR.  WE SHARE THE
FEELINGS OF THE SALVADORAN RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY.

   I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE PRESENCE OF CRISTIANI AT THE BURIAL
FOR THE JESUIT PRIESTS CALLS FOR A NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL OUTCRY
IN DEMAND FOR PUNISHMENT FOR THE PERSONS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS
ATROCIOUS ASSASSINATION.

   CRISTIANI CANNOT GO TO THAT BURIAL AND DO NOTHING ABOUT PEOPLE TO
WHOM HE OPENED DOORS SO THAT THEY COULD COMMIT THESE KILLINGS.
EVERYBODY MUST DEMAND THAT CRISTIANI RESPOND TO THE PEOPLE'S
INDIGNATION BY PUNISHING THE PERSONS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRIME.
CRISTIANI CANNOT SPEAK ABOUT HAVING MORAL AUTHORITY FOR ATTENDING THAT
BURIAL UNLESS HE PUNISHES THE PEOPLE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE.  IT IS NOT
ENOUGH TO PUNISH THE ASSASSINS.  THERE MUST BE A THOROUGH
INVESTIGATION OF THE WAVE OF CRIME THAT HAS BEEN UNLEASHED IN EL
SALVADOR.  THE MOST NOTORIOUS CRIME HAS BEEN THE KILLING OF THE JESUIT
PRIESTS, BUT IN THE PAST 8 DAYS MANY COMMON PEOPLE AND COMMUNITY
LEADERS HAVE ALSO BEEN MURDERED.  THE BOMBING HAS BEEN INTENSE.  THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE ENDURING MUCH PAIN AND THEY DEMAND THAT THE
PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT BE PUNISHED.

   WE AGAIN REITERATE THE PAIN OF THE PEOPLE OVER THE DEATH OF THE
JESUIT PRIESTS.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH MUST BRAVELY AND
LOUDLY DEMAND JUSTICE IN THE FACE OF THESE CRIMES.

DEV-MUC3-0824 (PRC)

   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMENTARY] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] AS WE SAID EARLIER, THERE ARE THREE POSITIONS.  THIS
PROVES THAT THERE ARE CONTRADICTIONS SURROUNDING THIS CASE.  THERE IS
WILLIAM WALKER, ACTING LIKE AN OSTRICH WITH HIS HEAD STUCK IN THE
GROUND.  AND THERE IS CRISTIANI'S POSITION -- THE DEATH SQUAD MEMBER
WHO WEARS A TIE, WHO [WORDS INDISTINCT] AFTER THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY [WORDS INDISTINCT], AND WHO SAID THAT RASH JUDGMENT SHOULD
NOT BE PASSED AND THAT NO ONE SHOULD BE IN A HURRY TO ACCUSE THE
GOVERNMENT OR ANYONE ELSE.  AND THERE IS ALSO THE GENERAL STAFF AND
DEFENSE MINISTRY POSITION BLAMING THE FMLN.  WHY?  IF IT IS TRUE THAT
THERE IS A CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT IN EL SALVADOR, THEN WHY CAN THE
DEFENSE MINISTER APPEAR BEFORE THE TELEVISION CAMERAS CONTRADICTING
CRISTIANI, GOING AGAINST WHAT CRISTIANI HAD SAID?  WHO GIVES THE
ORDERS HERE, LARIOS OR CRISTIANI?  IF CRISTIANI GIVES THE ORDERS, THEN
THE DEFENSE MINISTER MUST OBEY CRISTIANI AND REFRAIN FROM MAKING
ACCUSATIONS BEFORE A SERIOUS INVESTIGATION IS HELD.  HOWEVER, THIS IS
NOT THE CASE.

   THIS FURTHER PROVES WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SAYING.  THE CIVILIAN MASK
FELL ON SATURDAY.  THE DEFENSE MINISTRY HOLDS THE REAL POWER IN THE
COUNTRY.  THE DEFENSE MINISTRY CENSORS THE PRESS.  THE SOLDIERS ARE
THE ONES CENSORING THE TELEVISION STATIONS, AND NOT THE ARENA
[NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] FOLLOWERS OR OTHER
CIVILIANS.  THE GENERAL STAFF, THE SOLDIERS, ARE GAGGING THE PRESS,
IMPOSING THE STATE OF SIEGE, GIVING THE FINAL ORDERS.  IT IS IMPORTANT
TO LOOK INTO THIS CLOSELY BECAUSE GEN LARIOS, IN AN EMPTY SPEECH -- WE
HEARD HIM DELIVER A RHETORICAL AND EMPTY SPEECH -- ACCUSED THE FMLN OF
KILLING THE PRIESTS AND SAID THAT THE ARMY CONTROLS THE COUNTRY.  WE
POINT OUT THESE CONTRADICTIONS [WORDS INDISTINCT].

   BY SAYING THAT THEY DID NOT DO IT, THAT THE ARMED FORCES DID NOT DO
IT, THE DEFENSE MINISTER ADMITTED THAT HE DID IT, THAT HE IS ONE OF
THE KILLERS.  THAT IS WHAT GEN LARIOS IS SAYING, THAT IS WHAT HE SAID
IN HIS PUBLIC STATEMENT.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] NO DOUBT, AND THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS [WORDS INDISTINCT].  WE DO NOT BELIEVE IN
THE GOVERNMENT'S INVESTIGATIONS BECAUSE WE HAVE PAST EXAMPLES OF IT.
WE HAVE MONSIGNOR ROMERO'S CASE AND WE HAVE THE CASE OF THE
REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATIC FRONT LEADERS, WHO, A FEW YEARS AGO, WERE
ARRESTED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT DURING A POLICE OPERATION.  HOWEVER, NOT A
SINGLE SOLDIER HAS BEEN PUNISHED.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE IN CRISTIANI'S
JUSTICE.  THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS PUTTING ON THE PRESSURE AND
CRISTIANI WILL HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.  HE WILL PROBABLY PUT UP SOME
ACT.  THE U.S.  CONGRESS ALSO HAS ITS EYES ON EL SALVADOR.  THEY ARE
DEBATING THE ISSUE OF AID TO EL SALVADOR.  THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE THE
U.S.  CONGRESS MUST THINK ABOUT.  THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE SAID
THAT IT IS PLEASED WITH THE WAY CRISTIANI ACTED IN THE FACE OF THE
FMLN OFFENSIVE.  THIS MEANS THAT THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE HAS
APPROVED THE DROPPING OF WHITE PHOSPHORUS OVER ZACAMIL AND THE
DESTRUCTION OF 500 HOMES.  THIS MEANS THAT THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF
STATE HAS APPROVED THE KILLING OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, AND ALSO THE
MASSACRE OF SEVERAL SALVADORAN CITIZENS WHO WERE TAKEN FROM THEIR
HOMES AND KILLED ON THE SAME BLACK NIGHT WHEN THE JESUIT PRIESTS WERE
KILLED.

   CLANDESTINE, 20 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] HERE IS A VERY
IMPORTANT POINT THAT U.S. AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER SHOULD TAKE INTO
CONSIDERATION.  AMBASSADOR WALKER SEEMS TO BE A VERY BAD INVESTIGATOR, AS HE
IS STILL IN THE DARK AS REGARDS THE COWARDLY MURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS.
AFTER THE FUNERAL OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THE U.S. AMBASSADOR STILL EXPRESSED
DOUBTS REGARDING THE AUTHORS OF THIS CRIME.

   WELL, WE HAVE RECEIVED A REPORT STATING THAT THE MURDERERS OF THE
JESUITS FIRED MORE THAN 500 SHOTS AND STAYED IN THE RESIDENCE OF THE
SLAIN PRIESTS FOR 1 HOUR.  IN OTHER WORDS, 40 MEN IN THE UNIFORM OF
THE SALVADORAN ARMY WERE A FEW BLOCKS FROM THE GENERAL STAFF
PARTICIPATING IN SHOOTING THAT LASTED SEVERAL MINUTES, AND REMAINED IN
THERE FOR 1 HOUR, IN AN AREA UNDER THE ARMY'S CONTROL, IN AN AREA
UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE GENERAL STAFF.

   WE HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE U.S. AMBASSADOR.  HOW COULD 40 MEN IN
SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES UNIFORMS, AND WITH POLICE AND ARMY PATROLS
ONLY A FEW METERS AWAY FROM THE JESUITS' RESIDENCE, REMAIN IN THAT
PLACE FOR 1 HOUR IF THEY WERE NOT MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES?

   AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER, IF YOU STILL HAVE ANY SHAME, TELL THE
WORLD AND ANSWER THIS QUESTION: IF THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF DID
NOT KILL THE JESUIT PRIESTS, HOW COULD THE MURDERERS -- AS THIS
INTERNATIONAL DISPATCH SAYS -- REMAIN IN THE RESIDENCE FOR 1 HOUR
AFTER THE HEAVY SHOOTING, AFTER KILLING THE PRIESTS WITH MACHINEGUNS
IN TRIPODS, AS THE CABLE SAYS?

   WE WILL READ THIS DISPATCH WHICH IS BEING READ ALL OVER THE WORLD.
MAYBE WILLIAM WALKER DOES NOT EVEN READ INTERNATIONAL DISPATCHES,
BECAUSE HE CYNICALLY SAID AFTER THE PRIESTS' FUNERAL THAT HE HAD NO
EVIDENCE OR INDICATION THAT THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED BY THE ARMED
FORCES.  WELL, AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER, WE WILL READ THIS DISPATCH
TO YOU:

   THE [WORD INDISTINCT] IN UNIFORM WHO KILLED SIX JESUIT PRIESTS AND
TWO COMPANIONS IN SAN SALVADOR ON THURSDAY FIRED MORE THAN 500 SHOTS
AND REMAINED AT THE SCENE OF THE CRIME FOR ALMOST 1 HOUR.  WE REPEAT:
THEY WERE IN THE PRIESTS' RESIDENCE FOR ALMOST 1 HOUR, ACCORDING TO
PRIVATE INVESTIGATIONS CONDUCTED BY VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS.

   A FEW HOURS BEFORE THE FUNERAL, THE SCENE OF THE CRIME REVEALS SOME
OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES CONCERNING THE MACHINEGUNNING OF THE PRIESTS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 21 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] IN AN IRRATIONAL ACT
OF CRIMINAL TERRORISM, A GROUP OF FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT] OUTLAWS OCCUPIED PART OF THE SHERATON HOTEL FACILITIES WITH THE
MALEVOLENT INTENTION OF TAKING THE OAS SECRETARY GENERAL HOSTAGE.

   THANKS TO QUICK ACTION BY THE GLORIOUS ARMED FORCES, THE OAS
SECRETARY GENERAL IS NOW UNDER THE PROTECTION OF SPECIAL UNITS WHO ARE
IN THE PROCESS OF EVACUATING HIM FROM THE SITE.

   THE VISIT TO OUR COUNTRY BY DISTINGUISHED OAS SECRETARY GENERAL
BAENA SOARES HAS A PEACEFUL PURPOSE. THEREFORE, WE TOTALLY CONDEMN THE
FMLN MAKING HIM AN OBJECTIVE OF ITS TERRORIST ACTIONS.

   THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT STRONGLY CONDEMNS THIS ACTION.  AT THE
SAME TIME, IT URGES THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO JOIN THE OUTCRY OF
ALL CIVILIZED AND DEMOCRATIC NATIONS THAT CONDEMN THE FMLN FOR THIS
COWARDLY ATTACK ON THE OAS SECRETARY GENERAL.

   SAN JOSE (COSTA RICA), 22 NOV 89 (RADIO IMPACTO) -- [TEXT] A COLOMBIAN
CITIZEN WAS CAPTURED BY THE U.S. SECRET SERVICE IN PANAMA AFTER HE PLACED A
BOMB IN A MOVIE THEATER AT ONE OF THE U.S. SOUTHERN COMMAND'S MILITARY
BASES.

   APPARENTLY, THE BOMB WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE GONE OFF WHEN THE MOVIE
THEATER WAS SHOWING ONE OF ITS DAILY MOVIES AT NIGHT.

   ACCORDING TO [RADIO] IMPACTO SOURCES, THE INDIVIDUAL CONFESSED THAT
THE [DIGNITY] BATTALIONS, HEADED BY [BENJAMIN] COLAMARCO AND FOLLOWING
NORIEGA'S ORDERS, ARE READY TO BEGIN A CAMPAIGN OF TERROR AT U.S.
BASES.

   OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS, THE U.S.  SOUTHERN COMMAND HAS REPORTED
SEVERAL BOMB THREATS AT ITS MILITARY INSTALLATIONS, AND, FOR THIS
REASON, SECURITY AT THE BASES HAS INCREASED.

   PANAMA CITY (PANAMA), 21 NOV 89 (LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA) --
[STATEMENT] [CIVIC DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION ALLIANCE, ADOC] [TEXT] THE
ABOMINABLE ASSASSINATION OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS AND TWO OTHER PERSONS
IN EL SALVADOR DRAMATIZES THE TRAGEDY THAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE
SUFFERING.  DECADES OF MILITARY DICTATORSHIP AND SOCIAL INJUSTICE HAVE
CREATED A VICIOUS CYCLE OF VIOLENCE THAT HAS TAKEN AND CONTINUES TO
TAKE THOUSANDS OF LIVES.

   FROM THE BOTTOM OF OUR HEARTS, WE PANAMANIANS ARE HORRIFIED OVER
THIS TRAGEDY.  WE HOPE OUR SALVADORAN BROTHERS WILL FIND PEACE AS SOON
AS POSSIBLE BY EXAMINING AND BROADENING THROUGH A DIALOGUE THE
DEMOCRATIZATION THAT THEY HAVE COURAGEOUSLY UNDERTAKEN IN RECENT
YEARS.

   UPON REFLECTING ON EL SALVADOR'S BLOODY EXPERIENCE, WE DEMAND NOW,
MORE THAN EVER BEFORE, THAT THE CURRENT PANAMANIAN REGIME IMMEDIATELY
BEGIN THE PROCESS OF DEMOCRATIZATION IN OUR COUNTRY SO THAT WE CAN
ACHIEVE RECONCILIATION AMONG OURSELVES BEFORE A CYCLE OF FRATRICIDAL
VIOLENCE IS ESTABLISHED AMONG US.  PANAMA, 16 NOVEMBER 1989 [SIGNED]
GUILLERMO ENDARA GALIMANY, PRESIDENT-ELECT; DR RICARDO ARIAS CALDERON,

DEV-MUC3-0865 (GTE)

   SAN SALVADOR, 24 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] ATTORNEY GENERAL
MAURICIO COLORADO, INVESTIGATING THE MURDER OF THE SIX JESUITS IN EL
SALVADOR, SAID TODAY THAT THE DECLARATIONS MADE SO FAR, AMONG THEM
THOSE MADE BY LUCIA BARRERA CERNA, ONE OF THE MAIN WITNESSES, "ARE NOT
CONCLUSIVE, NOR HAVE THEY SHED ANY LIGHT" ON THE IDENTITY OF THE
KILLERS."

   THE JESUITS, FIVE SPANIARDS AND ONE SALVADORAN, WERE MURDERED 9
DAYS AGO BY A GROUP OF MEN WEARING MILITARY UNIFORMS DURING A "CURFEW"
DECREED BY THE GOVERNMENT AS A RESULT OF THE REBEL OFFENSIVE THAT
BEGAN ON 11 NOVEMBER.

   LUCIA BARRERA, WHO TESTIFIED BEFORE COLORADO, A GOVERNMENT
COMMISSION INVESTIGATING THE MURDERS, AND SEVERAL DIPLOMATS, AMONG
THEM SPANISH AMBASSADOR FRANCISCO CADIZ, SAID THAT THE MURDERERS
NUMBERED BETWEEN 30 AND 40 UNIDENTIFIED MEN WEARING MILITARY UNIFORMS.
COLORADO SAID IN A NEWS CONFERENCE THAT "THERE ARE SEVERAL WITNESSES,
NONE OF WHICH HAS SHED MUCH LIGHT ON THE CASE.  THEIR DECLARATIONS ARE
NOT CONCLUSIVE REGARDING THIS SAD AND REGRETTABLE EVENT."  HE STRESSED
"THAT IT WOULD BE RASH TO SAY THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMY DID IT."

   ACCORDING TO COLORADO, NEITHER FBI AGENTS FROM THE UNITED STATES,
NOR SCOTLAND YARD AGENTS FROM GREAT BRITAIN, NOR THE SPANISH
GOVERNMENT'S DELEGATES -- AS REQUESTED BY SALVDORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI WHEN HE PROMISED TO INVESTIGATE THE CASE EXHAUSTIVELY --
HAVE ARRIVED IN EL SALVADOR.

   HE SAID THAT THE COURT WILL SUBPOENA MARIA JULIA HERNANDEZ,
DIRECTOR OF THE SAN SALVADORAN ARCHBISHOPRIC'S LEGAL AID OFFICE, "TO
DECLARE WHAT SHE KNOWS, WHO TOLD HER WHAT, AND TO SAY IF SHE WAS AT
THE SCENE."

   THE ARCHBISHOPRIC'S LEGAL AID OFFICE, A HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATION,
HAS PROMISED TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION JOINTLY WITH THE JESUITS.

   THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID THAT "WE ARE INVESTIGATING ALL CLUES,"
WHEN ASKED BY REPORTERS IF HE WOULD INTERROGATE THE SOLDIERS WHO WERE
PATROLLING THE UNIVERSITY AREA WHERE THE MURDERS TOOK PLACE ON 16
NOVEMBER.

   MEANWHILE, JOSE MARIA TOJEIRA, JESUIT SUPERIOR IN CENTRAL AMERICA,
SAID THAT THE MAIN WITNESS TO THE MURDERS IS "SAFE AND SOUND" ABROAD,
POSSIBLY IN THE UNITED STATES.

   ACCORDING TO TOJEIRA, THE WITNESS, WHO WAS INTERROGATED REPEATEDLY,
WAS KEPT UNDER STRICT SECURITY. HE STRESSED THAT SHE LEFT FOR AN
UNKNOWN DESTINATION AND THAT SHE "IS AT EASE BECAUSE SHE HAS TOLD THE
TRUTH."

   JESUIT SUPERIOR TOJEIRA AND ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS, ARCHBISHOP OF
SAN SALVADOR, HAVE ASSERTED THAT THERE IS A STRONG BELIEF THAT THE
MURDERERS OF THE JESUITS WERE EITHER MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES OR
PERSONS CLOSELY LINKED TO THEM.

   WHEN ASKED ABOUT THIS BELIEF, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL REPLIED, "I DO
NOT HAVE THAT INFORMATION. HOWEVER, IT WOULD BE RASH TO SAY THAT THE
ARMY DID IT."

DEV-MUC3-0866 (GTE)

   SEOUL (ROK), 22 NOV 89 (HANGYORE SINMUN) -- [EDITORIAL] [TEXT] AT A
TIME WHEN THE WORLD'S ATTENTION IS RIVETED ON THE DEMOCRATIZATION
MOVEMENT IN EASTERN EUROPE, WE HEAR A GLOOMY NEWS REPORT THAT THE
PROTRACTED CIVIL WAR BETWEEN EL SALVADOR'S GOVERNMENTAL TROOPS
RECEIVING U.S. ASSISTANCE AND LEFTIST GUERRILLAS HAS RECENTLY ONCE
AGAIN INTENSIFIED, AND HAS TAKEN MANY LIVES.

   THE SOVIET UNION IS NOW PRODDING THE COUNTRIES IN EASTERN EUROPE,
WHICH WERE ONCE KNOWN AS SOVIET SATELLITES, TO DEMOCRATIZE AND TO
REFORM THEIR STATE SYSTEMS; WHY DOES THE UNITED STATES INCREASE ITS
MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR AND CAUSE THE CIVIL WAR TO INTENSIFY?

   LIKE MANY CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICAN COUNTRIES BEFORE THEY BECAME
DEMOCRATIZED, THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR IS
SUCH THAT IT IS PLAGUED BY AN EXTREME FORM OF THE GAP BETWEEN RICH AND
POOR, BY MILITARY DICTATORSHIP, BY RIGHT-WING TERRORISM, AND BY ABUSE
OF HUMAN RIGHTS TO THE POINT WHERE IT COULD BE ENGULFED BY REVOLUTION
AT ANY TIME.  HOW CAN A COUNTRY WHERE MORE THAN 2.5 MILLION OUT OF A
POPULATION OF 5.4 MILLION ARE ON THE BORDER OF STARVATION, AND WHERE
ROUGHLY 20 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION ENJOYS 66 PERCENT OF THE
COUNTRY'S GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT, BE IN PEACE?

   AFTER A LARGE-SCALE PEASANT UPRISING IN 1930, THE LEFTIST FORCES IN
THIS COUNTRY FORMED A UNIFIED GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION IN 1980 AND BEGAN
THE ARMED STRUGGLE IN EARNEST.

   THE OLIGARCHIC RULING CLASS, WHICH IS SAID TO CONSIST OF 15 TO 240
FAMILIES WITH HIGH INCOME, LAUNCHED A "CLEAN-UP OPERATION" AGAINST
GUERRILLAS IN COLLUSION WITH THE MILITARY, AND OPENLY MASSACRED THE
LEADERS OF WORKERS AND PEASANTS BY ORGANIZING AN EXTREME RIGHT-WING
ASSASSINATION GROUP CALLED THE "DEATH SQUAD."  THEY EVEN WENT SO FAR
AS TO ASSASSINATE INTELLECTUALS AND CLERGYMEN WHO CHAMPIONED SOCIAL
REFORM AND HUMAN RIGHTS.

   FILMS SUCH AS "ROMERO" AND "SALVADOR" THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN IN OUR
COUNTRY IN RECENT MONTHS ARE CLEAR EVIDENCE OF THE BRUTALITY COMMITTED
BY SUCH AN ASSASSINATION GROUP.  THIS GROUP WAS UNQUESTIONABLY BEHIND
THE RECENT ASSASSINATIONS IN WHICH 10 LABOR UNION LEADERS WERE
MERCILESSLY MASSACRED AND ANOTHER 8, INCLUDING A JESUIT PRIEST, WERE
BRUTALLY KILLED.

   THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE UNITED STATES LURKS BEHIND THE MILITARY AND
RIGHT-WING FORCES THAT ARE BENT ON SUPPRESSING THOSE WHO CALL FOR
SOCIAL REFORM AND RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS, NOT STOPPING AT A "CLEANING
UP" OF THE LEFTIST GUERRILLAS.  WHILE SENDING A GROUP OF MILITARY
ADVISERS TO EL SALVADOR TO HELP THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS MOP UP THE
GUERRILLAS, THE UNITED STATES IS NOW ALSO SUPPLYING THE COUNTRY WITH
WEAPONS, INCLUDING ASSAULT HELICOPTERS, WORTH U.S. $103 MILLION.

   HOW LONG WILL THE UNITED STATES RETAIN ITS OLD POLICY OF IGNORING
SOCIAL REFORM AND DEMOCRATIZATION IN A NEIGHBORING COUNTRY AND OF
GIVING MILITARY AID TO ITS INCOMPETENT GOVERNMENT IN ORDER TO DEFEND
ITS OWN INTERESTS?  WITH OUR EYES ON THE DEMOCRATIZATION MOVEMENT IN
EAST EUROPE, WE ARE COMPELLED TO THINK ONCE AGAIN OF THE
DEMOCRATIZATION IN CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA, AND OF THE OUTSIDE
INTERVENTION THERE BLOCKING THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.

   DRAWING A LESSON FROM THE DEFEAT IT SUFFERED IN VIETNAM AND IN
IRAN, THE UNITED STATES SHOULD CEASE INTERFERING IN THE INTERNAL
AFFAIRS OF OTHER COUNTRIES.

DEV-MUC3-0877 (GTE)

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), NO DATE (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [SPEECH]
[PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] I AM GOING TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING, AND I AM GOING TO SPEAK TO YOU FROM THE HEART.  ABOUT 15
DAYS AGO, I HEARD THE NEWS THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT, THE
SALVADORAN ARMY, WAS BOMBING NEIGHBORHOODS AND CITIES IN EL SALVADOR,
THAT IT WAS MURDERING THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  I LATER HEARD THAT THE
SALVADORAN ARMY HAD MURDERED SIX JESUIT PRIESTS, AMONG THEM A PRIEST
WHO HAD BEEN DEAN OF THE CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY HERE IN NICARAGUA.  IT
WAS THEN THAT I BEGAN TO THINK AND ASKED MYSELF: HOW CAN I WELCOME THE
PRESIDENT OF EL SALVADOR HERE IN NICARAGUA WHEN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
SUMMIT IS HELD?  WHAT A PROBLEM.  A REAL PROBLEM.  HOW COULD I WELCOME
IN NICARAGUA THE REPRESENTATIVE OF A GOVERNMENT THAT KILLS PRIESTS AND
BISHOPS, THAT KILLED MONSIGNOR ROMERO; A GOVERNMENT THAT KILLS
CLERGYMEN, THAT HAS KILLED NUNS AND MEMBERS OF OTHER CHURCHES,
CATHOLICS AND EVANGELISTS; A GOVERNMENT THAT KILLS WORKERS, PEASANTS,
LABORERS, AND LEADERS OF POLITICAL PARTIES, THAT HAS KILLED MORE THAN
600 CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADERS.  THEY WERE KILLED BY ARENA
[NATIONALIST REPUBLIC ALLIANCE], THE RULING PARTY IN EL SALVADOR, AND
THE SALVADORAN ARMY, WHICH IS THE SAME THING.  I KEPT ASKING MYSELF:
HOW CAN I WELCOME THEM IN NICARAGUA?  IT WOULD BE LIKE WELCOMING
SOMOZA.  ALL I COULD COME UP WITH WAS TO FIND AN EXCUSE NOT TO HOLD
THE MEETING.  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TERRIBLE FOR THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE TO
HAVE TO WELCOME AND HAVE AS A GUEST THE REPRESENTATIVE OF A GOVERNMENT
THAT KILLS PRIESTS, NUNS, WORKERS, LABORERS, PEASANTS, INTELLECTUALS,
PROFESSIONALS, AND WORKERS.  THEREFORE, THIS NEWS MADE ME HAPPY.  IT
MADE ME HAPPY BECAUSE WE HAVE AVOIDED THE PROBLEM OF HAVING TO
WELCOME, IN NICARAGUA, THE PRESIDENT OF THAT GOVERNMENT OF
INTERNATIONAL KILLERS AND COMMON CRIMINALS.  [APPLAUSE]

   THE TRUTH IS THAT WE SHOULD FEEL PROUD.  AS A NICARAGUAN I FEEL
PROUD THAT THAT MURDEROUS GOVERNMENT HAS BROKEN RELATIONS WITH
NICARAGUA.  THAT IS SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF, BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT
THEY KNOW PERFECTLY WELL THAT WE ARE ON THE SIDE OF THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE, ON THE SIDE OF THE SALVADORAN PEASANT, ON THE SIDE OF THE
SALVADORAN WORKER, ON THE SIDE OF THE SALVADORAN CHURCH AND PRIESTS,
THAT WE ARE ON THE SIDE OF PEACE, JUSTICE, AND DEMOCRACY IN EL
SALVADOR, AND THAT WE OPPOSE TYRANNY IN EL SALVADOR.

   I CAN SEE THAT THE TIME HAS COME FOR ME TO SPEAK CLEARLY TO YOU.  I
BELIEVE THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO SPEAK CLEARLY BECAUSE DIPLOMATIC
JARGON CAN SOMETIMES CONFUSE THINGS.  IT IS TIME THAT WE SPEAK
CLEARLY.  THE LEAST THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT CAN DO IN RESPONSE TO
THE ATTITUDE ASSUMED BY THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS TO ASK AND DEMAND
OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND THE WORLD THAT IT BREAK RELATIONS
WITH THAT MURDEROUS AND CRIMINAL GOVERNMENT UNTIL THOSE WHO KILLED THE
PRIESTS HAVE BEEN PUNISHED, UNTIL THOSE WHO ARE KILLING THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PUNISHED.  [APPLAUSE] THAT IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO
DEMAND.  THAT IS GOING TO BE OUR ANSWER.

   THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS UNEASY BECAUSE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING
IN EL SALVADOR.  CRISTIANI IS NO TAME DOVE.  HE HAS BECOME AN
ACCOMPLICE AND INSTRUMENT OF THIS POLICY OF DEATH IMPLEMENTED BY THE
ARMY, BY MEN LIKE [COLONEL RENE EMILIO] PONCE AND [GENERAL
JUAN RAFAEL] BUSTILLO.  THEY ARE MURDEROUS GUARDSMEN JUST LIKE
THOSE YOU KNEW, THE SOMOZIST GUARDSMEN.  BUSTILLO, PONCE, AND A FEW
OTHERS ARE JUST LIKE THAT.  HOWEVER, NOT ALL OF THEM ARE LIKE THAT.
THERE ARE SOME HONEST SOLDIERS IN EL SALVADOR, SOLDIERS WITH HONEST
POSITIONS.  [CONTINUED]

DEV-MUC3-0882 (GTE)

   CLANDESTINE, 27 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] ATTENTION. PAY
CLOSE ATTENTION.  ATTENTION.  PAY CLOSE ATTENTION.  AS WE HAVE ALREADY
REPORTED, U.S.  OFFICIALS, IMPORTANT PERSONS, AND POLITICIANS IN THE
UNITED STATES HAVE ISSUED STATEMENTS AFFIRMING THAT THE SALVADORAN
ARMED FORCES ARE DIRECTLY LINKED TO THE CASE OF THE MURDERED JESUITS.
THE TESTIMONY GIVEN BY THE LADY WHO WITNESSED THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
UNIVERSITY CRIME HAS CAUSED POLITICAL UPHEAVAL THAT IS ALSO BEING FELT
IN THE CORRIDORS OF THE U.S.  CONGRESS, THE WHITE HOUSE, AND THE
PENTAGON.

   EVEN ELLIOTT ABRAMS, FORMER ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR
INTER-AMERICAN AFFAIRS, HAS STATED ON THE FACE THE NATION TELEVISION
PROGRAM ON 27 NOVEMBER, THAT THE MURDER OF THE SIX JESUITS, A WOMAN,
AND HER DAUGHTER WAS AN ACTION BY THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES AND NOT
THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT].  ABRAMS,
A FORMER REAGAN ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL, STATED: BASED ON 10 YEARS
EXPERIENCE ON THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT, I PRESUME THAT THE DEATH OF THE
PRIESTS WAS NOT THE WORK OF LEFTIST GUERRILLAS, BUT AN ACTION BY
FORCES OF THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION.  WE DO NOT HAVE A RECORD OF
GUERRILLAS TAKING THIS SORT OF ACTION, SAID ELLIOT ABRAMS.  HE ADDED
THAT, IN THE PAST, MANY MILITARY OFFICERS HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH
THE SO-CALLED DEATH SQUADS AND THE RIGHTIST SECTOR IN EL SALVADOR.
THESE WERE THE STATEMENTS BY ELLIOT ABRAMS.  VOA HAS REPORTED THE
STATEMENTS BY THE WOMAN WHO WITNESSED THE CRIME.  AT THIS TIME IN THE
UNITED STATES, THE SALVADORAN TOP MILITARY COMMAND, COLONEL RENE
EMILIO PONCE, AND PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI ARE BEING POINTED OUT AS
THE PERSONS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ABOMINABLE CRIME.

   IN RELATION TO THIS, WE WANT TO DENOUNCE THE FOLLOWING TO THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES, AND THE
INTERNATIONAL MEDIA.  OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS, THE CRISTIANI
ADMINISTRATION HAS TRIED TO DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF THE UNITED STATES
THAT IS PRESENTLY CENTERED ON THE CASE OF THE MURDERED JESUITS AND THE
INVOLVEMENT OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IN THIS CRIME.  WE DENOUNCE
THE ARREST OF U.S. CITIZEN JENNIFER CAZOLO AS PART OF A SALVADORAN
ARMED FORCES PLAN TO ATTEMPT TO DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF INTERNATIONAL
PUBLIC OPINION FROM THE JESUITS' CASE.  WE ALSO DENOUNCE THE ARREST OF
JENNIFER CAZOLO AS A REPRESSIVE ACT.  ALSO, THE ARMED FORCES IS TRYING
TO LINK HUMANITARIAN AID FOR EL SALVADOR, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND U.S.-BASED
ORGANIZATIONS TO THE FMLN.  IT IS TRYING TO LINK THESE ORGANIZATIONS
AND THESE PERSONS TO THE FMLN.

   THE FMLN COMPLETELY DENIES THAT IT HAS ANY LINK WITH U.S. CITIZEN
JENNIFER CAZOLO.  WE DENOUNCE THIS ACCUSATION AS A CLUMSY SET UP BY
THE ARMED FORCES COMMAND, WHICH IS TRYING -- WE REPEAT -- TRYING TO
REPRESS THESE HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS AND FOREIGNERS.  THIS IS A
SET UP BY THE ARMED FORCES TO REPRESS FOREIGN CITIZENS AND -- WE
REPEAT -- IT IS A SMOKE SCREEN TO DIVERT U.S. ATTENTION FROM THE CASE
THAT IS PRESENTLY ON THE TABLE.  IT IS A SET UP TO NOT ATTEND THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'S DEMAND FOR JUSTICE IN THE CASE OF THE JESUIT
PRIESTS.

   IF ELLIOT ABRAMS, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INTER-AMERICAN
AFFAIRS, WHO KNOWS SO MUCH ABOUT EL SALVADOR, SAYS THAT IT WAS NOT THE
FMLN AND THAT THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED BY MILITARY UNITS AND PERSONS
LINKED TO THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION, HIS STATEMENTS WILL HAVE
STRONG REPERCUSSIONS IN THE UNITED STATES.  THE ARMED FORCES COMMAND
AND THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION ARE TRYING TO DO ALL THEY CAN TO
THROW A SMOKESCREEN HERE AND THERE TO TRY TO DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND, ESPECIALLY, THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED
STATES.

   IN CONCLUSION, WE REAFIRM: WE DENY THE ARMED FORCES' ACCUSATIONS
AGAINST U.S. CITIZEN JENNIFER CAZOLO.  WE STATE THAT THE ACCUSATION IS
A CLUMSY SET UP TO HIDE AND NOT RESPOND TO THE QUESTION EVERYONE IS
ASKING -- WHERE ARE THE MURDERERS OF THE JESUITS?  BEHIND THE CLUMSY
SET UP WITH REGARD TO THE U.S. CITIZEN, WE ALSO SEE THAT THEY INTEND
TO CONTINUE TO REPRESS HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS AND DIFFERENT
SECTORS THAT HAVE EXPRESSED SOLIDARITY WITH EL SALVADOR.  IN SHORT,
ALL THIS SET UP ATTEMPTS TO DO IS THROW A HUGE SMOKESCREEN TO REPRESS
THESE ORGANIZATIONS AND FOREIGNERS.

   SANTIAGO, 27 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [EXCERPTS] THE
RADIO MINERIA SANTIAGO STAFF CONTINUES TO EVALUATE THE SUBSTANTIAL
DAMAGE CAUSED BY A TERRORIST ATTACK AT THE OFFICES OF RADIO MINERIA.

   ERNANI VALDA, THE DIRECTOR OF THE RADIO STATION, HAS REPORTED
THAT SO FAR THE DAMAGE IS ESTIMATED AT 2.5 MILLION PESOS.

   THE BOMB WAS PLACED IN THE OFFICE OF POLITICAL COMMENTATOR GERMAN
GAMONAL, WHO IS ALSO THE PRESS DIRECTOR.  FIVE PEOPLE WERE WORKING AT
THE OFFICES WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED; ONE OF THEM WAS INJURED.

   WE SPOKE WITH REPORTER HERMOGENES CARRILLO, WHO ARRIVED AT THE
RADIO STATION OFFICES AFTER THE ATTACK.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CARRILLO] ONE PERSON SUFFERED MINOR INJURIES AND
THE OFFICES OF RADIO MINERIA WERE SUBSTANTIALLY DAMAGED DURING THE
BOMB ATTACK HERE AT THE INTERSECTION OF PROVIDENCIA AND TOBALABA
STREETS THIS MORNING AT 0510. [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   THE RADIO STATION WAS OFF THE AIR FOR 45 MINUTES, DURING WHICH TIME
CARABINEROS PERSONNEL INSPECTED THE SITE TO CONFIRM THAT THERE WERE NO
OTHER BOMBS.

   GOPE [SPECIAL OPERATIONS GROUP] PERSONNEL ARRIVED LATER.
ACCORDING TO THEIR SPECIALIZED PERSONNEL THE BOMB CONTAINED TRONEX
[EXPANSION UNKNOWN], AND IT HAD BEEN PLACED BY ONE OF THE WINDOWS ON
PROVIDENCIA STREET.

   AT LEAST TWO OR THREE PEOPLE WERE INVOLVED IN THE ATTACK.  THEY
SOMEHOW CLIMBED TO THE SECOND FLOOR, PLACED THE BOMB, LIT THE FUSE,
AND FLED.

   NO WARNING WAS RECEIVED NOR HAS ANY SUBVERSIVE MOVEMENT CLAIMED
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS ATTACK SO FAR.

   WE HAVE RECEIVED TELEPHONE CALLS FROM OUR LISTENERS ACROSS THE
COUNTRY.  WE HAVE ALSO RECEIVED IMPORTANT POLITICAL PERSONALITIES,
INCLUDING PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HERNAN BUCHI AND INTERIOR MINISTER
CARLOS CACERES.

   AMONG OTHERS, WE HAVE RECEIVED A CALL FROM OSORNO FROM
[PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE] FRANCISCO JAVIER ERRAZURIZ AND
ANOTHER CALL FROM SANTIAGO FROM RICARDO LAGOS.

   THIS IS ALL WE CAN REPORT FOR NOW.  THE COST HAS NOT YET BEEN
ESTIMATED, BUT IT WILL BE SUBSTANTIAL.

   THIS WAS A REPORT BY RADIO MINERIA FOR RADIO NACIONAL DE CHILE.
[END RECORDING]

DEV-MUC3-0890 (GTE)

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 28 NOV 89 (PL) -- [TEXT] HEAVY CLASHES ARE
STILL TAKING PLACE IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR FOLLOWING A NIGHT OF
FIERCE COMBAT, WHICH CONFIRMS PREDICTIONS ON THE INTENSIFICATION OF
THE WAR THIS WEEK.

   PRESS REPORTS RELEASED FROM SAN SALVADOR AT NOON TODAY REPORT THE
CONTINUATION OF CLASHES BETWEEN THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] AND THE ARMED FORCES, BASICALLY IN
NEIGHBORHOODS IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR.

   AYUTUXTEPEQUE, SOYAPANGO, ZACAMIL, AND SAN RAMON, ON THE OUTSKIRTS
OF SAN SALVADO, SEEM TO HAVE BEEN OCCUPIED AGAIN BY GUERRILLA COLUMNS,
WHICH CONTROLLED THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS DURING THE FIRST DAYS OF THE
NATIONAL OFFENSIVE WHICH BEGAN ON 11 NOVEMBER.

   IN ITS MOST RECENT NEWSCAST, THE FMLN'S RADIO VENCEREMOS REPORTED
THE AIR FORCE HEAVILY BOMBED AYUTUXTEPEQUE, A DENSELY POPULATED
NEIGHBORHOOD, AND CONFIRMED THE CLASHES TAKING PLACE IN SOYAPANGO.

   THE SOURCE REPORTED THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES ELITE TROOPS, AND
EVEN INFANTRY BRIGADES FROM MILITARY DETACHMENTS TRADITIONALY
STATIONED IN THE COUNTRYSIDE, HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED TO SAN SALVADOR IN AN
ATTEMPT TO REPEL THE REBELS' ACTIONS.

   ACCORDING TO THE GUERRILLA REPORTS, DESPITE THE CONTINUOUS
BOMBINGS, CLASHES ARE TAKING PLACE AT THIS TIME IN THE CAPITAL OF SAN
MIGUEL DEPARTMENT, IN THE EASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY.  SEVERAL
SECTORS OF THE PANAMERICAN HIGHWAY, ESPECIALLY IN EASTERN SAN
SALVADOR, REMAIN UNDER THE FMLN CONTROL, RADIO VENCEREMOS REPORTED.

   THE CENTRAL AMERICAN MEDIA TODAY WARNED ABOUT THE SERIOUSNESS OF
THE INCIDENTS IN SAN SALVADOR THIS MORNING, WHEN GROUPS OF
UNIDENTIFIED MEN MACHINEGUNNED FORMER SUPREME COURT PRESIDENT
FRANCISCO GUERRERO, A WELL- KNOWN LEADER OF THE RIGHTWING NATIONAL
CONCILIATION PARTY. SOURCES CONSULTED IN SAN SALVADOR, WHICH PREFER
NOT TO BE IDENTIFIED, SAID IT IS A FACT THE FAR RIGHTWING IS LINKED TO
THIS CRIME.  THE SAME SOURCES MAINTAINED THAT THE RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT
ON THE SUSPENSION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH MANAGUA, MADE BY
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI, CAUSED DISAGREEMENTS AMONG THE GOVERNMENT
BRANCHES AND AMONG THE VARIOUS PARTIES.

DEV-MUC3-0905 (GTE)

   SAN SALVADOR, 30 NOV 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] THERE IS A TENSE
CALM, INTERRUPTED BY SPORADIC SHOOTING, IN THE EXCLUSIVE ESCALON
NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL TODAY.  AT THE SAME TIME, MANY
FOREIGNERS ARE LEAVING THE NEIGHBORHOOD, WHICH WAS THE SITE OF HEAVY
FIGHTING BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES AND GUERRILLAS YESTERDAY.

   AN OFFICIAL OF THE UN OFFICE, WHICH IS LOCATED IN THE AREA OF
FIGHTING, TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT "ALL THE PERSONNEL ARE FINE AND WE ARE
NOW EVACUATING SOME EMPLOYEES AND FOREIGNERS LIVING IN THE AREA,
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE CEASE-FIRE" THAT WAS ORDERED BY THE SALVADORAN
GUERRILLAS FOR SEVERAL HOURS.

   "WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY GUERRILLAS.  THE SOLDIERS ARE IN THE AREA AND
ENTRANCE IS RESTRICTED.  THEY ARE ONLY PERMITTING THE EVACUATION," THE
OFFICIAL SAID OVER THE TELEPHONE.

   A SPOKESMAN OF THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE (COPREFA) SAID THIS
MORNING THAT THE ELITE COUNTERINSURGENCY BELLOSO AND ATLACATL
BATTALIONS AND TROOPS WITH ARTILLERY ARE CARRYING OUT A SPECIAL
OPERATION IN ESCALON TO DISLODGE THE REBELS.  THE SPOKESMAN SAID THE
OPERATION WILL INCLUDE ALL OF NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR.  HOWEVER, HE SAID
HE COULD NOT PROVIDE FURTHER INFORMATION BECAUSE "WE ARE STILL
COMPILING INFORMATION."

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) ON 29 NOVEMBER
RESUMED ITS ATTACKS IN SAN SALVADOR, ESPECIALLY IN THE UPPER CLASS
NEIGHBORHOODS OF ESCALON, SAN BENITO, AND MAQUILISHUAT AND THE MIDDLE
CLASS NEIGHBORHOODS OF JARDIN GUADALUPE, LA CIMA, AND LOMAS DE SAN
FRANCISCO.

   AFTER SEVERAL HOURS OF FIGHTING IN THE STREETS OF THE
NEIGHBORHOODS, THE ARMY SAID IT HAD THE SITUATION UNDER CONTROL.
HOWEVER, IT ADMITTED THAT THE REBELS HAD ENTRENCHED THEMSELVES IN
ESCALON AND HAD SEIZED "THE RESIDENTS AS HOSTAGES."

   THE GUERRILLAS ANNOUNCED LAST NIGHT THAT FROM 0600 TO 1200 (1200 -
1800 GMT) TODAY, 30 NOVEMBER, THEY "WILL UNDERTAKE THE EVACUATION OF
FOREIGN PERSONNEL" IN THE ESCALON AND SAN BENITO NEIGHBORHOODS IN
NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR.  THE FMLN SAID THE MEASURE, WHICH IS BEING
HEEDED BY THE FOREIGNERS LIVING IN THOSE AREAS, IS TO GUARANTEE THE
LIVES OF THE RESIDENTS OF ESCALON.

   VARIOUS SOURCES SAID THE REBELS HAVE LEFT ESCALON, BUT THIS
INFORMATION HAS YET TO BE CONFIRMED.

DEV-MUC3-0910 (GTE)

   CARACAS (VENEZUELA), 30 NOV 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS
ANDRES PEREZ REFERRED TODAY TO THE MURDER OF SIX JESUITS AND TWO WOMEN IN
SAN SALVADOR AND SAID THAT "THERE IS A GENERALIZED SUSPICION THAT NO ONE CAN
HIDE, AND IT IS THAT THE EXTREME RIGHT AND NOT THE EXTREME LEFT COMMITTED
THESE MURDERS."

   PEREZ, WHO EXPRESSED HIS VIEWPOINTS ABOUT THE SALVADORAN SITUATION
DURING HIS NEWS CONFERENCE AT THE MIRAFLORES PALACE, SAID THAT IT IS
VERY IMPORTANT THAT THESE CRIMES BE INVESTIGATED AND THAT THE
RESPONSIBLE PARTIES BE PUNISHED.  HE ADDED THAT HE HAS TELEPHONED
SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH
AND TOLD THEM ABOUT THIS.

   THE VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT SAID THAT IN SPITE OF THE FACT THE
EVIDENCE POINTS IN ONE DIRECTION TO THE AUTHORS OF THE CRIMES
COMMITTED ON 16 NOVEMBER, "WE CANNOT TAKE ANY SIDES IN THIS ISSUE,
PARTICULARLY WHEN WE ARE TRYING TO FIND A SOLUTION, AND THAT IS
EXACTLY WHAT WE HAVE DONE."

   CONCERNING THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO SUSPEND COOPERATION
WITH THE GOVERNMENTS OF EL SALVADOR AND NICARAGUA, PEREZ POINTED OUT
THAT THIS ACTION IS ONE WAY OF MAINTAINING AN ACTIVE NEUTRALITY.

   ACCORDING TO THE VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT, THE SPANISH STAND IS ONE OF
COOPERATION SO THAT THERE WILL BE PEACE AND UNDERSTANDING IN CENTRAL
AMERICA, BECAUSE IT IS WITHDRAWING THE AID AS LONG AS IT IS UNCLEAR
HOW SERIOUS THE CONFLICTING PARTIES ARE ABOUT REACHING AN AGREEMENT.

PRIEST AND FOUR WORKERS OF THE DOMINICAN ORDER -- THREE SALVADORANS AND ONE
U.S. CITIZEN -- WERE ARRESTED IN SAN SALVADOR ON 30 NOVEMBER.

   THE DOMINICAN SUPERIOR TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT THE SPANISH PRIEST CARLOS

CENTER IN CIUDAD CREDISA, A SAN SALVADOR NEIGHBORHOOD, AND ARRESTED
THE FIVE PERSONS AFTER CONDUCTING A SEARCH.

   THE PRIEST WAS VISITING SAN SALVADOR AND HAD ARRIVED IN THE CITY 2

   A SPANISH EMBASSY OFFICIAL IN SAN SALVADOR IS PRESENTLY MAKING
EFFORTS TO VISIT CARLOS DIEZ AND THE OTHER PERSONS ARRESTED, IN THE
PRESENCE OF SALVADORAN OFFICIALS.

DEV-MUC3-0924 (GTE)

   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMENTARY] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] NOW THEY ARE STILL DOING THE SAME THING, EXCEPT THAT THE
KILLINGS ARE THOSE OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THE PLACES BURNED ARE HOMES IN THE
DENSELY POPULATED NEIGHBORHOODS AND THE UN HEADQUARTERS, AND THOSE ACCUSED
OF COLLABORATING WITH THE FMLN ARE THE EPISCOPAL CHURCHES.  THE STRATEGY IS
THE SAME.  THE FMLN CONTINUES TO STRIKE AT AND MOCK THE ARMED FORCES.  FAR
FROM DIMINISHING IN NUMBER, IT HAS INCREASED IN NUMBER.  THE PERSECUTION OF
THE CHURCH, THE INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS, THE PRESS CENSORSHIP, AND, ABOVE
ALL, THE APPARENT DIRECTION TAKEN BY THE SITUATION AS A RESULT OF THE ARMED
FORCES' LEADERSHIP HAVE SHOWN THE WORLD THAT NOTHING HAS CHANGED.  THE
MILITARY CONTINUES TO BE IN COMMAND, AND CRISTIANI'S MODERATION WAS BUT A
COSTLY MAKEOVER.

   THE U.S. ANALYSTS ARE BEGINNING TO REACT.  AFTER 9 YEARS OF
INVESTING AT ALL LEVELS TO PUT AN END TO THE CAPITAL AND THE PRINCIPAL
CITIES OF THE COUNTRY WITH A STRATEGIC SIEGE, WITH THE THEATER OF
OPERATIONS IN THE TROUBLE SPOTS, AND WITHOUT ANY PROSPECT OF
CONTROLLING THE SITUATION, THE ORDER OF THE DAY IN THE HALLS OF
CONGRESS IS A CHANGE OF POLICY AND THE PROMOTION OF NEGOTIATION.  ALL
THE WORLD IS SUFFERING DEEPLY, WITHOUT THE HOPE OF A CHANGE OF POLICY.
WHAT THE U.S. CONGRESS IS STUDYING IS WHETHER IT WILL CONTINUE WITH
THAT POLICY WHICH DOES NOT CHANGE AT ALL, WHICH PROTECTS THE ASSASSINS
OF MONSIGNOR ROMERO, THE FOUR U.S. NUNS, IGNACIO ELLACURIA, AND FIVE
MORE JESUITS.  IT IS STUDYING WHETHER IT IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO
SUPPORT A FASCIST PARTY AND A CRIMINAL-RIDDEN ARMED FORCES AND THUS
CONDEMN THIS PART OF THE WORLD SO CLOSE TO THEIR BORDERS TO TERRIBLE
SUFFERING, OR WHETHER THE TIME OF CHANGE HAS ARRIVED IN THE UNITED
STATES.  THE POLICY TOWARD EL SALVADOR MUST BE CHANGED TO ACHIEVE THE
GOAL OF DEMOCRACY SO THAT PLURALISM WILL GIVE WAY TO DEMOCRACY,
JUSTICE, AND PEACE.  THE UNITED STATES CAN CONTRIBUTE TO PEACE IN EL
SALVADOR, BUT IN ORDER TO DO SO IT MUST CHANGE ITS POLICY.

DEV-MUC3-0930 (SRI)

   SAN SALVADOR, 5 DEC 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] VIOLENT CLASHES BETWEEN THE
SALVADORAN GUERRILLA FORCES AND THE ARMY TODAY AGAIN SHOOK THE
NORTHWEST SECTOR OF SAN SALVADOR, AFTER A FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) COLUMN RAIDED THE TOWN OF SAN ANTONIO ABAD.

   AT LEAST FIVE MILITARY AND REBEL DEATHS, THREE STORES PARTIALLY
DESTROYED, AND ONE ELECTRIC POLE BLOWN UP ARE THE PRELIMINARY RESULTS
OF THE CLASHES IN SAN ANTONIO ABAD, BETWEEN 2100 ON 4 DECEMBER AND
0200 5 DECEMBER.

   THE FMLN GUERRILLA FORCES TODAY ALSO ATTACKED ARMY POSITIONS IN
AYUTUXTEPEQUE, A WORKERS' NEIGHBORHOOD NORTH OF THE CAPITAL, AND LA
CIMA NEIGHBORHOOD, SOUTHEAST OF THE CAPITAL, WHERE THE CLASHES WERE
STILL UNDERWAY AT MID-MORNING.

   THE ARMY ADMITTED THAT ONE SOLDIER DIED AND FIVE WERE WOUNDED
DURING THE CLASHES IN SAN ANTONIO ABAD, A MIDDLE CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD
LOCATED BESIDE THE ESCALON RESIDENTIAL AREA; AND AT LEAST FOUR REBELS
WERE RIPPED TO PIECES BY A LAW [LIGHT AATI-TANK WEAPON] ROUND.

   LOTS OF BLOOD AND PIECES OF FLESH STUCK TO BACKPACKS AND MILITARY
UNIFORM FRAGMENTS WERE SCATTERED IN A-30 METER AREA WITHIN AN EMPTY
LOT IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA OF THE TOWN.

   AN OFFICER OF THE NATIONAL POLICE'S ELITE PANTERA BATTALION, WHICH
PARTICIPATED IN THE FIGHTING, TOLD AFP: "THE ROUND FELL EXACTLY WHERE
THEY WERE.  AT LEAST FOUR DIED ON THE SPOT AND MANY WERE WOUNDED."

   THE REBELS BLEW UP A GROCERY STORE AND AN ELECTRIC POLE IN DOWNTOWN
SAN ANTONIO ABAD; AND ONE DRUGSTORE AND OTHER STORES ALSO SUSTAINED
CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE DURING THE FIGHTING.

   TENSION AND NERVOUSNESS PREVAILED THIS MORNING IN SAN ANTONIO ABAD,
WHERE MANY PERSONS WERE LOOKING FOR EXPLOSIVES AND TNT LEFT BEHIND BY
THE REBELS.

   ARMY SPOKESMEN HAVE YET TO ISSUE A REPORT ON THE FIGHTING AT LA
CIMA AND AYUTUXTEPEQUE, BUT THE PEOPLE OF AYUTUXTEPEQUE SAID THERE WAS
FIERCE FIGHTING IN THE SECTOR, ADDING THAT THE REBELS ENTRENCHED
THEMSELVES INSIDE THE LOCAL CHURCH TO FIRE AT THE GOVERNMENT'S TROOPS.

   MEANWHILE, REPORTS FROM THE INTERIOR INDICATE THAT THE FIGHTING
DIMINISHED TODAY IN THE REGION OF ZACATECOLUCA, USULUTAN, AND SAN
MIGUEL, WHERE THE MILITARY SITUATION WAS EXTRAORDINARILY TENSE UNTIL
THE NIGHT OF 4 DECEMBER.

   NEVERTHELESS, THE GOVERNMENT TODAY EXPLAINED THAT THE REDUCTION IN
CURFEW HOURS, FROM 2100 TO 0500 EFFECTIVE LAST NIGHT, DOES NOT APPLY
FOR THE CITY OF ZACATECOLUCA, CAPITAL OF LA PAZ DEPARTMENT -- LOCATED
IN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE COUNTRY -- WHICH THE GUERRILLA FORCES HAVE
BEEN CONSTANTLY HARASSING THROUGHOUT THE WEEK.

   MEANWHILE, THE FMLN WARNED THE OWNERS OF COMMERCIAL AND CROP
DUSTING AIRPLANES TO ABSTAIN FROM USING THEIR PLANMES FOR THE ARMY TO
CONDUCTRE RECONAISSANCE FLIGHTS IN THE REGION OF ZACATECOLUCA AND
USULUTAN, "BECAUSE THEY WILL BE CONSIDERED MILITARY TARGETS."

THE DRUG TRAFFICKING MAFIAS THAT ARE OPERATING IN THE COUNTRY.

   "THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY FOR A TRUCE WITH DRUG TRAFFICKERS," THE
ACTING MINISTER SAID.  HE POINTED OUT THAT "THE SLAUGHTER," WHICH HE
HAD WARNED ABOUT LAST WEEK BEFORE THE CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES, IS
NOW UNDER WAY.

   LEMOS HAS OPPOSED THE INCLUSION OF THE EXTRADICTION TO THE UNITED
STATES OF COLOMBIANS CHARGED WITH DRUG TRAFFICKING IN A REFERENDUM
SCHEDULED FOR 21 JANUARY.

   LEMOS SEIZED THAT OPPORTUNITY TO URGE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS (CHAMBER
AND SENATE) TO KEEP EXTRADICTION AS A TOOL TO PUNISH DRUG TRAFFICKERS.

   A GROUP OF PARLIAMENTARIANS HAVE INSISTED ON INTRODUCING THE
EXTRADICTION ISSUE IN THE REFERENDUM.  THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THAT
THIS IS A PERNICIOUS ACTION, BECAUSE IT COULD INCREASE THE TERRORISM
THAT IS SCORCHING THE COUNTRY.

   "THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT CANNOT BE DEPRIVED OF A TOOL SUCH AS
EXTRADICTION," LEMOS CONCLUDED.

   LAST NIGHT THE CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES SURPRISINGLY APPROVED A
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO INCLUDE THE EXTRADICTION ISSUE IN THE
REFERENDUM.

DEV-MUC3-0940 (SRI)

   SANTIAGO, NO DATE (RADIO CHILENA NETWORK) -- [INTERVIEW WITH AYLWIN
BY SOLA] [EXCERPTS] [CONTINUED] [SOLA] RELATIONS BETWEEN CHILE AND
BOLIVIA HAVE BEEN BROKEN.  WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE BEST WAY TO FACE
BOLIVIA'S DEMAND FOR A SEA OUTLET?

   [AYLWIN] FIRST, CHILE MAINTAINS A FIRM STAND ON THIS SUBJECT, A
FACT THAT MUST BE CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD BY THE CHILEAN PEOPLE AND THE
REST OF THE WORLD.  CHILE DOES NOT HAVE ANY BORDER CONFLICTS WITH
BOLIVIA.  OUR BORDER WITH BOLIVIA HAS BEEN RATIFIED BY AN
INTERNATIONAL TREATY THAT WAS FREELY APPROVED BY OUR TWO COUNTRIES.
THIS TREATY CONSTITUTES AN OBLIGATORY NORM FOR CHILE AND BOLIVIA.

   SECOND, ACCORDING TO THIS TREATY, CHILE HAS ALWAYS BEEN WILLING TO
GRANT BOLIVIA TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES TO PORTS ON THE PACIFIC COAST.

   THIRD, IN FACE OF THE BOLIVIAN ASPIRATIONS TO OBTAIN GREATER
FACILITIES OR A NEW TRANSIT SYSTEM, THE FIRST THING TO BE DONE IS TO
REESTABLISH DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS.  THIS IS A BILATERAL ISSUE BETWEEN
BOLIVIA AND CHILE.  IT IS NOT AN HEMISPHERIC MATTER OR A MATTER TO BE
DECIDED BY INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS.

   I TRUST THAT BOLIVIA AND CHILE WILL REESTABLISH DIPLOMATIC
RELATIONS IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF FRIENDSHIP AND COOPERATION.  WE MUST BE
AWARE THAT THE WORLD IS HEADING TOWARD INTEGRATION AND THAT IT IS MORE
CONVENIENT FOR ALL OF US TO ATTAIN THE BEST AND MOST INTEGRATED
RELATIONS POSSIBLE.  WE MUST SEEK SOLUTIONS AND, AS THE BOLIVIAN
PRESIDENT RECENTLY STATED, WE MUST SEEK IMAGINATIVE SOLUTIONS WITH A
21ST CENTURY AND NOT A 19TH CENTURY VIEW.  I HOPE THAT WITHIN THIS
SPIRIT WE WILL MANAGE NOT ONLY TO REESTABLISH RELATIONS WITH BOLIVIA,
BUT TO ESTABLISH SATISFACTORY RELATIONS FOR THE TWO COUNTRIES.

   [SOLA] CHILEAN RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES HAVE NOT BEEN
EXCELLENT OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, AND THE MURDER OF ORLANDO LETELIER
IS TIED INTO THIS SITUATION.  WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON THIS SUBJECT,
CONSIDERING THAT A U.S. COURT HAS REQUESTED THE EXTRADITION OF GENERAL
CONTRERAS AND COLONEL ESPINOZA?

   [AYLWIN] WELL, I HOPE THAT CHILE WILL MAINTAIN THE BEST RELATIONS
POSSIBLE WITH ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE UNITED
STATES, A COUNTRY WITH WHICH WE ARE LINKED FOR MANY REASONS.  I
DISCUSSED THIS SUBJECT WITH PEOPLE FROM U.S. DIPLOMATIC, POLITICAL,
AND ECONOMIC CIRCLES, AND I HAVE NOTED THEIR WILLINGNESS TO IMPROVE
RELATIONS AND SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY SEPARATING US AS
SOON AS A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT IS REESTABLISHED.

   I DO NOT THINK THAT AN EXTRADITION WILL SOLVE THE LETELIER CASE
BECAUSE IT HAS ALREADY BEEN RULED ON BY THE SUPREME COURT.  IT IS WHAT
WE LAWYERS REFER TO AS AN ADJUDGED MATTER.  I THINK THAT CHILE CAN
DEMONSTRATE ITS WILLINGNESS TO HELP CLARIFY THE CASE AND GUARANTEE
JUSTICE, AS IT IS OUR [WORD INDISTINCT] PURPOSE IN ALL HUMAN RIGHTS
PROBLEMS, SO AS TO SATISFY THE MOST DEMANDING CONSCIENCES OF THE
WORLD. [PASSAGE OMITTED]

HELICOPTERS IN THE INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY.  THOUSANDS OF SAN SALVADOR
RESIDENTS WERE ABLE TO SEE THE DOWNING OF A HELICOPTER GUNSHIP IN THE
METROPOLITAN AREA.  WE DOWNED A HELICOPTER GUNSHIP THAT WAS SHOOTING AT THE
CIVILIAN POPULATION IN SOYAPANGO, SAN SALVADOR.  WE HAD ALREADY WARNED [AIR

GOING TO ALLOW MORE GENOCIDIAL ACTIONS IN SAN SALVADOR.  ONCE AND FOR ALL, WE
REAFFIRM TO THE FASCIST COMMAND STAFF THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW MORE
BOMBING IN SAN SALVADOR.  STARTING RIGHT NOW, GENTLEMEN, THE PEOPLE FORBID
THAT YOU BOMB THE CITY.  WE FORBID YOU TO DO SO, AND FOR THAT PURPOSE WE
WILL DOWN YOUR AIRPLANES AND HELICOPTERS.  OUR PEOPLE KNOW THAT AN A-37
AIRCRAFT WAS DOWNED IN SAN MIGUEL, A HELICOPTER WAS DOWNED IN SAN MIGUEL AT
THE BEGINNING OF THE OFFENSIVE, A PUSH-PULL PLANE WAS DOWNED IN USULUTAN,
AND NOW THIS HELICOPTER IN SOYAPANGO.  WE AWAIT A REPORT ON THE POSSIBLE
DEATH OF THE HELICOPTER'S CREW.  WE AWAIT AN OFFICIAL REPORT FROM OUR
COMRADES IN SOYAPANGO.

   MEANWHILE, WE ALSO HAVE REPORTS THAT FIGHTING CONTINUES AT THIS
TIME IN THE NORTHEASTERN AREA OF SAN SALVADOR.  WE AWAIT AN OFFICIAL
REPORT ON THE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES THAT HAVE BEEN INFLICTED ON THE

   TOKYO (JAPAN), 7 DEC 89 (KYODO) -- [TEXT] COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO
BARCO VARGAS SAID HERE ON THURSDAY HIS GOVERNMENT WILL NOT BOW TO TERRORIST
THREATS EXEMPLIFIED BY WEDNESDAY'S BOMB EXPLOSION IN BOGOTA.

   BARCO, WHO IS ON A FOUR-DAY VISIT TO JAPAN THROUGH FRIDAY, SAID
THAT SUCH SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES ARE BASED ON THE MISTAKEN BELIEF OF
TERRORISTS THAT VIOLENCE CAN TOPPLE THE GOVERNMENT.

   HE SAID HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD FIGHT OFF SUCH CHALLENGES.

   A TRUCK, PACKED WITH DYNAMITE, EXPLODED IN FRONT OF THE
HEADQUARTERS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE SECURITY, COLOMBIA'S
FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS POLICE, ON WEDNESDAY.

   AT LEAST 35 PEOPLE DIED AND 350 PEOPLE WERE WOUNDED IN THE BLAST,
WHICH IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN RELATED TO THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT'S
ATTEMPTS TO ELIMINATE THE DRUG TRADE.

   COLOMBIA IS SAID TO BE THE LARGEST EXPORTER OF THE ILLICIT DRUG,
COCAINE, TO THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER WESTERN COUNTRIES.

   THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAS INTENSIFIED ITS CRACKDOWN ON THE
COCAINE SMUGGLERS SINCE THE ASSASSINATION OF A LEADING PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE ON AUGUST 18.

   BARCO, SPEAKING AT THE JAPAN NATIONAL PRESS CLUB EXPRESSED CONCERN
ABOUT AN INCREASE OF COCAINE CONSUMPTION IN THE UNITED STATES AND
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, AND CALLED FOR WESTERN INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS TO
HELP STABILIZE THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN COLOMBIA, WITH PARTICULAR
EMPHASIS ON MORE ECONOMIC SUPPORT.

   ASKED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY COLOMBIA WOULD CALL ON THE UNITED
STATES TO HELP SOLVE THE PROBLEM WITH ARMED FORCES, THE PRESIDENT
EMPHASIZED HE HAS NO INTENTION OF ALLOWING ANY INTERFERENCE BY FOREIGN
COUNTRIES IN HIS NATION.

   BARCO IS SCHEDULED TO LEAVE JAPAN FOR COLOMBIA FRIDAY.

DEV-MUC3-0947 (SRI)

   CARACAS (VENEZUELA), 7 DEC 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS
ANDRES PEREZ PREDICTED A SERIOUS CRISIS ON THE CONTINENT IF A SOLUTION FOR
THE CENTRAL AMERICAN CONFLICT IS NOT FOUND.  HE APPEALED TO "THE FOREIGN
POWERS" TO HALT THEIR INTERVENTION IN THE SUBREGION.

   IN A NEWS CONFERENCE BROADCAST OVER TELEVISION FOR ALL THE COUNTRY,
PEREZ TODAY PREDICTED THAT THE COMING CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS
SUMMIT TO BE HELD IN SAN JOSE WILL FAIL IF WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS
"FOREIGN POWERS" DO NOT HALT MILITARY AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE
VARIOUS FACTIONS FIGHTING IN THE CONVULSED REGION.

   THE COSTA RICAN, NICARAGUAN, GUATEMALAN, SALVADORAN, AND HONDURAN
PRESIDENTS WILL MEET IN SAN JOSE SHORTLY TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THE
SALVADORAN CONFLICT AND REACTIVATE THE ESQUIPULAS II AND TELA
PACIFICATION ACCORDS.

   "IF THE FOREIGN POWERS, BE THEY THE UNITED STATES, CUBA, THE SOVIET
UNION, OR WHATEVER, PERSIST ON DISTURBING A DIRECT ANALYSIS AND
PREVENTING A FRIENDLY AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
PRESIDENTS, THIS SUMMIT WILL COME TO NOTHING," PEREZ POINTED OUT.

   PEREZ SAID THAT THE RECENT FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT [FMLN] OFFENSIVE IN EL SALVADOR INTERFERED SERIOUSLY WITH THE
REGIONAL PACIFICATION PROCESS.  HE REQUESTED THAT THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT CLARIFY THE DEATH OF SIX JESUITS WHO WERE MURDERED BY THE
DEATH SQUADS.

   "THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE SALVADORAN CRISIS OCCURRED AT AN
UNTIMELY MOMENT, WHEN THINGS WERE GOING SO WELL.  THE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THIS, HOWEVER, RESTS HEAVILY WITH THE FMLN AND THOSE WHO GAVE ARMS
TO THE REBELS SO THEY COULD CARRY OUT SO MAJOR A MILITARY OPERATION,"
HE SAID.

   HE ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT "THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS ACCOUNTABLE
FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SIX JESUITS, WHO WERE MURDERED IN A LOWLY AND
WICKED MANNER. THIS MUST BE CLARIFIED ALSO," HE SAID.

   THE VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT, WHO OFFERED TO MEDIATE IN THE SALVADORAN
CONFLICT, SAID HE REPORTED TO COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS, THE
SUMMIT'S HOST, THE CONTENTS OF A LETTER THAT THE FMLN SENT TO PEREZ,
IN WHICH THE ORGANIZATION PROPOSES A CEASE-FIRE WITH INTERNATIONAL
VERIFICATION.

   PEREZ ASKED THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE BECAUSE
"THE FATE OF ALL OF LATIN AMERICA IS AT STAKE."

   REFERRING DIRECTLY TO THE SAN JOSE SUMMIT -- HE SAID HE WAS
INSTRUMENTAL IN CHOOSING COSTA RICA AS SITE FOR THE MEETING -- PEREZ
ASSUMED AN "OPTIMISTIC YET CONCERNED" STANCE WITH REGARD TO THE
MEETING'S RESULTS.

   HE FINALLY SAID: "THIS SAN JOSE SUMMIT WILL MAKE THINGS CONFORM TO
ESQUIPULAS II AND TELA IF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS ARE LEFT
ALONE AND PARTICULARLY IF THEY KNOW THAT NONE OF THEM WILL BE BACKED
BY ANY ONE POWER WITH ARMS OR MONEY."

   BOGOTA, 7 DEC 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [TEXT]
INVESTIGATIONS CONTINUE TO DETERMINE WHO PLACED A CAR BOMB IN FRONT OF THE
DAS [ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY] FACILITIES.

   ACCORDING TO THE DAS DIRECTOR, A SPANISH TERRORIST AND ETA [BASQUE
FATHERLAND AND LIBERTY] MEMBER WHO COULD HAVE ADVISED THE
COLOMBIANS ON THE PREPARATION OF THE CAR BOMB HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED.

   DAS DIRECTOR GENERAL MIGUEL MAZA MARQUEZ ATTENDED THE FUNERAL OF
HIS SUBORDINATES AND FELLOW WORKERS WHO WERE KILLED AS A RESULT OF AN
EXPLOSION IN FRONT OF THE DAS FACILITIES.  AT THE END OF THE RELIGIOUS
CEREMONY, GEN MAZA SAID THAT HE DOES NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT
FOREIGN TERRORISTS PARTICIPATED IN THE ATTEMPT ON HIS LIFE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [GEN MAZA] THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT THIS COULD BE SO,
BECAUSE THE METHODS AND SYSTEM USED TO FABRICATE THE CAR BOMB LEAD US TO
BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE EXPERTS IN THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY.  [END RECORDING]

   GEN MAZA, WITH SADNESS IN HIS EYES, ADDED THAT HE WILL CONTINUE
WORKING IN THE SAME OFFICE WHERE THE ATTACK OCCURRED.

DEV-MUC3-0957 (SRI)

   CLANDESTINE, 6 DEC 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE] [GENERAL
COMMAND OF THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY, URNG] [TEXT]
WE CONDEMN GUATEMALAN INTERVENTION IN EL SALVADOR.  THE URNG GENERAL
COMMAND EXPRESSES ITS STRONG SOLIDARITY AND DEEP ADMIRATION FOR THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THEIR VANGUARD, THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT], WHO WITH GREAT HEROISM AND DETERMINATION
ARE WRITING ONE OF THE MOST GLORIOUS PAGES OF ITS HISTORY.

   WE VIEW WITH PROFOUND INDIGNATION HOW THE OFFICERS OF LA TANDONA
[REFERENCE TO THE 1966 GRADUATING CLASS OF THE CAPTAIN GERARDO BARRIOS
MILITARY ACADEMY] AND THE ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] GOVERNMENT
HEADED BY CRISTIANI, IN VIEW OF THEIR INABILITY TO DEFEAT, REPEL, OR CONTAIN
THE HEROIC FMLN, HAVE DECIDED TO CONTINUE MASSIVE BOMBINGS AGAINST
DEFENSELESS CIVILIANS, SOW DEATH AND DESTRUCTION, AND COMMIT MASSACRES.

   THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AND THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES, WHICH ARE
DESPERATE DUE TO THE VICTORIOUS ADVANCES OF THE FMLN FORCES -- WHICH
HAVE NOT ONLY MAINTAINED, BUT EXPANDED THEIR POSITIONS IN SAN SALVADOR
AND THE REST OF THE TERRITORY OF THAT FRATERNAL COUNTRY -- HAVE LOST
CONTROL.

   WITH VENGEANCE IN THEIR MINDS, THEY HAVE BEGUN TO IMPLEMENT A
NUMBER OF CRIMINAL ACTIONS AGAINST ALL THOSE IDENTIFIED WITH THE JUST
STRUGGLES OF THE MAJORITY.  AT DAWN ON 16 NOVEMBER, SIX JESUIT PRIESTS
AND TWO HUMBLE WOMEN WHO WORKED FOR THEM WERE BRUTALLY ASSASSINATED.
WE SHARE THE GREAT SORROW OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THE COMMUNITY
OF JESUIT PRIESTS AND ADD OUR PROTEST TO THOSE OF OTHERS THROUGHOUT
THE WORLD WHO HAVE ALREADY PROTESTED THESE DESPICABLE ASSASSINATIONS.

   THE URNG GENERAL COMMAND STRONGLY CONDEMNS THIS INCIDENT AND URGES
ALL GUATEMALANS AND ALL POLITICAL, SOCIAL, DEMOCRATIC, AND RELIGIOUS
ORGANIZATIONS TO SPEAK OUT IN THE FACE OF THESE GENOCIDAL AND BARBARIC
ACTIONS THAT ARE ONLY COMPARABLE TO WHAT THE UNITED STATES DID IN
VIETNAM AND THE NAZIS DID IN WORLD WAR II.

   IN OUR 13 NOVEMBER STATEMENT, WE DENOUNCED THE GUATEMALAN ARMY'S
INTERVENTIONIST PLANS AGAINST THAT FRATERNAL COUNTRY.  ON 15 NOVEMBER,
PRESS AGENCIES REPORTED THAT THE GUATEMALAN ARMY HAD DEPLOYED 126
UNITS OF THE SPECIAL KAIBILES [COUNTERINSURGENCY] TROOPS, WHO
ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR PATHOLOGICAL SAVAGERY.

   PRESIDENT CEREZO, THE COMMANDER OF THE MILITARY STAFF, AND THE
OFFICIAL SPOKESMAN OF THE GUATEMALAN ARMED FORCES HAVE PUBLICLY
EXPRESSED THEIR SOLIDARITY WITH CRISTIANI AND THE SALVADORAN ARMY.  WE
CONDEMN WITH ALL OUR STRENGTH THE GUATEMALAN ARMY'S INTERVENTION AMONG
THE GLORIOUS SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   WE CALL ON ALL SEGMENTS OF THE GUATEMALAN POPULATION TO EXPRESS
THEIR OPPOSITION AGAINST THIS INTERVENTION.  WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE
GUATEMALAN ARMY AND GOVERNMENT PAY DEARLY FOR THEIR AGGRESSION AGAINST
THE FRATERNAL SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  WE ADVISE THE WORLD THAT EL SALVADOR
MIGHT FACE AN EVEN WORSE GENOCIDE THAN THE ONE IT IS CURRENTLY
ENDURING.  WE ARE SURE THAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WILL DEFEAT ALL
THEIR ENEMIES, WIN THIS HISTORIC STRUGGLE, AND ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS.
THE BLOOD THAT HAS BEEN SHED WILL BREED NEW LIFE AND WILL UNDOUBTELY
LEAD US TO FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY, AND PEACE.

   GUATEMALA CITY, 17 NOVEMBER 1989

DEV-MUC3-0958 (SRI)

   SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE (RADIO CADENA SONORA) -- [REPORT] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] [CRISTIANI] "JUST A FEW WORDS TO EXPLAIN THE CURRENT MILITARY
SITUATION.  WE BELIEVE THAT STILL, REGRETTABLY, FOLLOWING THE FMLN'S
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] IRRATIONALITY, WE CANNOT RULE
OUT A CONTINUATION OF THEIR VIOLENT ACTIONS.  WE KNOW THAT AROUND THE
CAPITAL THERE ARE STILL GROUPS OF TERRORISTS, ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTHERN
AREA, IN THE NORTHWEST -- THE SAN SALVADOR VOLCANO-- AND IN THE NORTHEAST,
TO THE NORTH OF SOYAPANGO MUNCIPALITY.  THE MILITARY, HOWEVER, HAVE TAKEN
THE OFFENSIVE IN THESE THREE AREAS WHERE THE FMLN GROUPS HAVE BEEN CHASED.
FIGHTING HAS TAKEN PLACE OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS, WITH OVER 100 CASUALTIES
INFLICTED UPON THE FMLN IN 3 DAYS.

   "WE BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THEY HAVE LEFT WITHIN THE CAPITAL GREAT
NUMBERS OF WEAPONS, SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED.  SOME GROUPS
ARE IN HIDING, USING CIVILIANS, AND ARE CARRYING OUT TERRORIST
ACTIVITIES.  THEY HAVE BURNED BUSES, GASOLINE STATIONS AND MURDERED DR
FRANCISCO JOSE GUERRERO; AND ON 7 DECEMBER, THEY FIRED THREE OR FOUR
MORTAR ROUNDS AT RANDOM, FALLING ON PRIVATE HOMES.  ONE OF THEM FELL
ON THE HOUSE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE PRESIDENT.  WE BELIEVE
THESE ACTIONS ARE JUST MERE TERRORISM, INDISCRIMINATELY FIRING MORTARS
ON THE CAPITAL'S CIVILIANS.

   "WE BELIEVE THEY HAVE NO FURTHER CAPACITY EXCEPT TO CARRY OUT THESE
TERRORIST ACTS TO CREATE CONFUSION AND ANARCHY AMONG THE CIVILIAN
POPULATION.  THANK GOD, OUR POPULATION IS VERY BRAVE AND HEROIC. WE
HAVE BEEN NOTICING WITH PRIDE HOW THE POPULATION HAS BEEN WORKING
NORMALLY IN ALL OF SAN SALVADOR, GOING TO THEIR JOBS, WITH BUSINESSES
OPENING AND TRYING TO OPERATE NORMALLY.  THERE ARE STILL SOME THREATS
IN THE CITY OF SAN MIGUEL, WHERE A GROUP OF TERRORISTS ARE
CONCENTRATED TO THE NORTHEAST OF THE CITY.  HERE, TOO, THE ARMED
FORCES HAVE BEGUN AN OFFENSIVE AND QUICKLY END ANY IMMINENT DANGER."

   PRESIDENT CRISTIANI SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION AT THE 10
DECEMBER PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT WILL BE OPEN TO THE POSSIBILITY OF
RESTARTING A DIALOGUE WITH THE INSURGENTS ON 20 DECEMBER, IN CARACAS,
VENEZUELA, AS LONG AS THE FMLN NO LONGER CARRIES OUT ARMED ACTIONS IN
URBAN AREAS, BUT THEY DO NOT HAVE TO LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND SHOULD
CONTINUE ACTIONS ONLY AGAINST MILITARY TARGETS.

   [CRISTIANI] "AS YOU ALL HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE FOR YOURSELVES, THE
GOVERNMENT HAS NEVER BEEN AGAINST CONTINUING THE DIALOGUE PROCESS TO
FIND A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT.  IT HAS BEEN THE
FMLN THAT UNILATERALLY BROKE THIS DIALOGUE PROCESS BY NOT TURNING UP
AT CARACAS, VENEZULA, AS HAD BEEN AGREED IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA.  WE,
HOWEVER, ARE GOING TO MAKE A DEFINITE PROPOSAL IN COSTA RICA, WHICH IN
GENERAL TERMS IS AS FOLLOWS:

   "THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO RESTART THE DIALOGUE
PROCESS.  MOST CONVENIENT WOULD BE FOR THIS TO TAKE PLACE IN CARACAS,
WITH THE FOLLOWING CONDITION: BEGINING 15 DECEMBER, 3 DAYS AFTER THE
CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL MEETING [3-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION],
THE FMLN SHOULD PUBLICLY DECLARE AND GIVE PROOF OF COMPLIANCE THAT IT
WILL END ALL TYPES OF TERRORIST ACTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT DIRECTLY
OR INDIRECTLY AFFECT CIVILIANS.  WE WANT TO CLARIFY THAT WE ARE NOT
ASKING THEM TO LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS, AS WAS ATTEMPTED MANY TIMES.  IF
THE FMLN CONTINUES ITS IRRATIONAL BEHAVIOR, THE ARMED FORCES WILL
CONTINUE FIGHTING THEM.  TERRORIST ACTIONS AGAINST CIVILIANS MUST END.
THE PEOPLE DO NOT DESERVE TO CONTINUE BEING THE MOST AFFECTED BY THE
IRRATIONALITY OF ALL THIS FIGHTING. WE THINK THE LEAST THE FMLN CAN DO
IS TO STOP ALL ACTIONS THAT AFFECT, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, THE
CIVILIAN POPULATION.  MILITARY TARGETS ARE SOMETHING ELSE; BUT IF WE
ANALYZE THINGS, UP TO THIS MOMENT NOT A SINGLE MILITARY OBJECTIVE WAS
THE TARGET SINCE 11 NOVEMBER.  THEY HAVE NOT EVEN BEEN ABLE TO TAKE
OVER A CIVIL DEFENSE POST.  ALL ACTIONS HAVE BEEN AGAINST CIVILIANS,
TRYING TO INTIMIDATE THEM, TRYING TO CREATE TERROR AMONG THE
POPULATION.  THE CESSATION OF TERRORIST ACTS SHOULD BE THE FMLN'S
PROOF OF SINCERITY AND WILL TO REALLY TRY AND SEEK A SOLUTION BY WAY
OF DIALOGUE.  IF THE FMLN TODAY ACCEPTS ENDING ALL ACTIONS AGAINST THE
CIVILIAN POPULATION, THEN WE ARE WILLING ON 20 DECEMBER TO GO TO
CARACAS AND TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE PROCESS AND TALKS ON ALL THE
TOPICS THE FMLN WISHES TO TALK ABOUT. THJIS WILL BE IN ORDER TO ENSURE
THAT BY 15 FEBRUARY WE HAVE A SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT."  [CONTINUED]

DEV-MUC3-0959 (SRI)

   SAN SALVADOR, 10 DEC 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] MSGR ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS,
ARCHBISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR, STATED TODAY THAT "THE UNITED STATES SAYS
THAT IT WANTS TO HELP IMPROVE THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN EL
SALVADOR. HOWEVER, IN THE CASE OF THE INVESTIGATION OF THE MURDER OF
THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS, IT IS OBSTRUCTING JUSTICE."

   ARCHBISHOP RIVERA Y DAMAS SAID, "I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE PURPOSE OF
ASSUMING THIS ATTITUDE IS.  HOWEVER, WHEN EYEWITNESS LUCIA BARRERA DE
CERNA FIRST TESTIFIED, SHE CLEARLY DESCRIBED THE MEN AS BEING DRESSED
AS SOLDIERS AND NOT AS GUERRILLAS. I BELIEVE THAT IT IS EASY TO
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN ONE WAY OF DRESSING AND ANOTHER."

   IT SEEMS THAT THE PLAN IS TO LEAD THE INVESTIGATION THROUGH OTHER
PATHS, AND THAT IS WHY THE U.S. OFFICIALS TOOK THE EYEWITNESS TO THE
UNITED STATES, "WHERE SHE WAS GIVEN AN AUTHENTIC BRAINWASHING AND
THREATENED WITH DEPORTATION IF SHE DID NOT TELL THE TRUTH."

   ACCORDING TO THE JESUITS' LAWYER, SCOTT GRATHEAD, MRS. CERNA WAS
SUBJECTED TO AN "AGGRESSIVE AND VIOLENT" QUESTIONING SESSION.  AFTER
THIS PSYCHOLOGICAL TORMENT, SHE THOUGHT IT OVER AND RETRACTED HER
STATEMENT.  FORTUNATELY, ONCE RID OF THE PRESSURE FROM HER
"PROTECTORS," SHE HAS RETAKEN THE PATH OF TRUTH.

   IN HIS HOMILY TODAY, THE ARCHBISHOP DENOUNCED THE UNITED STATES FOR
TREATING THE WITNESS DIFFERENTLY ONCE SHE ARRIVED IN THE UNITED
STATES, INSTEAD OF PROTECTING HER LIKE THE U.S.  EMBASSY OFFICIALS IN
SAN SALVADOR HAD PROMISED, KNOWING THAT THE HUMBLE WORKING WOMAN
"FREELY AND SINCERELY HAD DECLARED WHAT SHE HAD SEEN AND HEARD THE
NIGHT OF THE HORRIBLE MASSACRE."  THE JESUIT PRIESTS WERE MURDERED ON
THE MORNING OF 16 NOVEMBER.

   REFERRING TO THE STATEMENT MADE BY THE NATION'S ATTORNEY GENERAL,
WHO SAID THAT THE CHURCH HAS REFUSED TO COOPERATE WITH THE
INVESTIGATION OF THE MURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS -- A LAWYER-PRIEST
HAD BEEN APPOINTED TO COOPERATE WITH THE INVESTIGATION -- THE
ARCHBISHOP SAID THAT THIS STATEMENT IS NOT ONLY FALSE BUT ALSO
MALICIOUS.

   IN HIS HOMILY TODAY THE PRELATE SAID THAT, IN THE FIRST PLACE, IT
THE LAYMEN'S GROUND, AND THAT IS WHERE THEY SHOULD PROVE THEIR
EXPERTISE AND MORAL INTEGRITY. THEY SHOULD IMBUE THE EXERCISE OF THEIR
PROFESSION WITH EVANGELICAL VALUES.

   THE ARCHBISHOP SAID THAT, IN THE SECOND PLACE, "IT COULD BE A
TRAP."  HE ADDED THAT THE CHURCH IS NOT GOING TO ENDORSE WITH A
CLERGYMAN'S PRESENCE SOMETHING THAT IS ALREADY BEGINNING TO BE
"MURKY."

   THE CHURCH AND OTHER SECTORS LINKED TO THE INVESTIGATION IN AN
INDEPENDENT WAY HAVE BEEN DISTRUSTFUL EVER SINCE THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL'S OFFICE SHOWED ITS ATTITUDE TOWARD LUCIA BARRERA DE CERNA'S
TESTIMONY.  SHE WAS TESTIFYING AT THE SPANISH EMBASSY BEFORE LAWYERS
AND AMBASSADORS, AND AS THE CURFEW HOUR APPROACHED, THEY TOOK THE
WITNESS TO ANOTHER EMBASSY.  THE NEXT DAY TWO DISTRICT ATTORNEYS CAME
TO HARASS THE WITNESS WITH QUESTIONS.

   THE ARCHBISHOP ONCE AGAIN REJECTED THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S
ACCUSATION.  HE REITERATED THE BELIEF THAT THE ARMED FORCES WERE
GUILTY OF THE MURDERS.  HE SAID, "I AM NOT MAKING ANY ACCUSATIONS.
HOWEVER, THE CHURCH IS VERY ANNOYED, AND ALTHOUGH I AM NOT SAYING THAT
WE ARE THE OBJECT OF OFFICIAL PERSECUTION, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF
THIS REGIME THERE IS PERSECUTION IN OTHER SECTORS."

DEV-MUC3-0962 (SRI)

   SAN JOSE (COSTA RICA), 10 DEC 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] SALVADORAN
DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL RAFAEL LARIOS TODAY REJECTED THE CHRISTMAS
TRUCE PROPOSED BY SOME COUNTRIES AT THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT AND
DEMANDED THAT THE GUERRILLAS END HOSTILITIES AS A PRIOR CONDITION FOR
THE DIALOGUE TO BE RESUMED.

   THE MINISTER, WHO ALWAYS LABELED THE REBELS "TERRORISTS," SAID THAT
THIS "IS NOT THE TIME FOR TRUCES, BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED
THAT THEY DO NOT WORK."  COSTA RICA PROPOSED A "CHRISTMAS TRUCE" TODAY
BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN ARMY AND GUERRILLAS TO ALLEVIATE THE EXISTING
TENSION IN THE AREA IN THE WAKE OF THE HEIGHTENED FIGHTING IN EL
SALVADOR, WHICH HAS LEFT 2,000 DEAD IN THE PAST MONTH.

   LARIOS, HOWEVER, AGREED THAT THE DIALOGUE "CAN BEGIN" WITHOUT THE
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) TURNING OVER ITS
WEAPONS BEFOREHAND.  "THE GUERRILLAS DO NOT NECESSARILY HAVE TO TURN
OVER THEIR WEAPONS FOR THE DIALOGUE TO BEGIN," LARIOS STATED.

   THE SALVADORAN GENERAL DENIED THAT THE FMLN CAN ESTABLISH ITSELF IN
CERTAIN "TERRITORIES" WHILE THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE HELD.  "THE FMLN
TERRORISTS ARE NOT IN ANY SPECIFIC PLACE," LARIOS STATED, AND THEN
NOTED THAT THE GUERRILLAS WILL RECEIVE "GUARANTEES" FOR THEIR SAFETY
IF THEY END HOSTILITIES AND BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS "TO REJOIN POLITICAL
LIFE."

   LARIOS REJECTED THE FMLN CHARGES AGAINST RANKING MILITARY OFFICERS,
WHO IT ACCUSED OF MASTERMINDING THE KILLING OF THE SIX JESUITS, FIVE
OF WHOM WERE SPANIARDS, AND TWO WOMEN.

REPORTED THAT, FOR THE THIRD DAY IN A ROW, STRONG BATTLES ARE BEING

   SAN JOSE (COSTA RICA), 11 DEC 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] NICARAGUAN
INFORMATION MINISTER MANUEL ESPINOZA TODAY EMPHATICALLY DENIED A HONDURAN
RADIO STATION'S REPORT THAT A HONDURAN FISHING BOAT WAS ATTACKED BY A
SANDINIST ARMY HELICOPTER.

   ACCORDING TO TEGUCIGALPA'S RADIO AMERICA, THE ALLEGED INCIDENT
OCCURRED ON THE ATLANTIC, OFF BLUEFIELDS, AND REPORTEDLY LEFT AN
UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF DEAD AND WOUNDED.

   ESPINOZA SAID IN COSTA RICA, WHERE HE IS ACCOMPANYING PRESIDENT
DANIEL ORTEGA TO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN SUMMIT, THAT "THE REPORT ON THE
ATTACK WAS RELEASED WITH THE INTENTION OF INTERFERING IN THE MEETING
OF THE REGION'S PRESIDENTS."

   THE TRUTH IS, ESPINOZA SAID, THAT LAST WEEK A HONDURAN FISHING BOAT
WAS SEIZED ON THE ATLANTIC BECAUSE IT WAS FISHING IN NICARAGUAN
WATERS, AND THE CREW SUBSEQUENTLY MUTINIED AND KILLED A SANDINIST
SOLDIER.

   THE MINISTER SAID THAT "NO INCIDENT OCCURRED TODAY."

   HONDURAN AUTHORITIES REPORTED TODAY THAT 36 PEOPLE ARE MISSING AND
14 SURVIVED THE ATTACK ON THE FISHING BOAT.  THEY SAID THE SURVIVORS
HAVE BEEN RESCUED.

DEV-MUC3-0969 (SRI)

   MANAGUA, 20 MAR 89 -- [COMMENTARY] [TEXT] THE MURDER OF THREE
JOURNALISTS IN EL SALVADOR YESTERDAY ONCE AGAIN SHOWS THE REPRESSIVE AND
CRIMINAL NATURE OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY.

   THOSE ACTIONS AGAINST OUR PRESS COLLEAGUES ARE ONLY COMPARABLE WITH
ACTIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE ARMIES IN CHILE, PARAGUAY, AND OTHER MILITARY
DICTATORSHIPS.  THE SOMOZIST ARMY COMMITTED SIMILAR CRIMES IN NICARAGUA.  WE
JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER THE COLD WAY IN WHICH U.S.  JOURNALIST BILL STEWART
WAS KILLED WHILE COVERING THE LAST PHASE OF THE INSURRECTION IN MANAGUA'S
WESTERN NEIGHBORHOODS.

   IN EL SALVADOR, FOREIGN AND NATIONAL JOURNALISTS ARE DEMANDING A SERIOUS
INVESTIGATION FROM PRESIDENT DUARTE'S GOVERNMENT TO PUNISH THE MILITARY MEN
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRIME.  WILL THE ARMY'S HIGH COMMAND BE WILLING TO
CONDUCT THE INVESTIGATION?  WE DOUBT IT, BASED ON ITS LACK OF WILLINGNESS TO
RECTIFY THINGS IN THE PAST REGARDING OTHER CASES, SUCH AS THE ASSASSINATION
OF MSGR ROMERO AND THE MURDER OF HERBERT ANAYA, PRESIDENT OF THE HUMAN
RIGHTS COMMISSION.  AFTER ALL, THAT IS THE WAY IN WHICH NAPOLEON DUARTE'S
CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT RESTRAINS FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION IN HIS
COUNTRY.  MORE THAN 11 JOURNALISTS HAVE BEEN KILLED BY THE SALVADORAN ARMY
SINCE 1981.  

   MEANWHILE, IN NICARAGUA, JOURNALISTS FROM INDEPENDENT MEDIA ARE CONCERNED
ABOUT 39 FORMER SOMOZIST GUARDS WHO ARE STILL IN JAIL BECAUSE OF THEIR
CRIMINAL RECORDS, TO THE POINT OF LAUNCHING JOURNALISTIC CAMPAIGNS DEMANDING
FROM THE GOVERNMENT THE RELEASE OF THE HARMLESS PIGEONS.

   WHAT WILL THEY SAY NOW ABOUT THE SALVADORAN ARMY, WHICH MURDERED THEIR
COLLEAGUES WHO WERE COMPLYING WITH THEIR DUTY TO INFORM THE PUBLIC?  WILL
THEY DEFEND THEM AS THEY DEFENDED THE SOMOZIST GUARDS?  THEY PROBABLY WILL.
THEY WILL TRY TO PLAY DOWN THE ACTION, BECAUSE THEY HAVE LOST THEIR DIGNITY,
GOOD SENSE, AND PROFESSIONAL PRIDE A LONG TIME AGO.

DEV-MUC3-0977 (SRI)

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 12 DEC 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] NICARAGUAN
PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA HAS REPORTED THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMY IS
BOMBING THE AREA SURROUNDING A VOLCANO NEAR THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL
TONIGHT, "THREATENING THE LIVES AND SECURITY OF SALVADORANS."

   IN A RADIO AND TELEVISION ADDRESS TO NICARAGUANS TO EXPLAIN THE
SCOPE OF THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED ON 12 DECEMBER IN COSTA RICA -- WHERE
THE SIXTH CENTRAL AMERICAN SUMMIT WAS HELD -- ORTEGA POINTED OUT THAT
THESE BOMBINGS "ARE AGAINST THE AGREEMENTS" WHICH WERE RECENTLY
SIGNED.

   "THE BOMBS THE SALVADORAN ARMY IS LAUNCHING DO NOT HELP AT ALL IN
COMPLYING WITH THE AGREEMENTS WE SIGNED ON 12 DECEMBER IN COSTA RICA,"
PRESIDENT ORTEGA, WHO SPOKE CALMLY, WARNED.  ORTEGA APPEALED TO THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT TO CEASE THE BOMBINGS.

   THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT INSISTED ON THE "GREAT RESPONSIBILITY" OF
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IN THE FULFILLMENT OF THE AGREEMENTS, PARTICULARLY
WITH REGARD TO THE POINTS THAT DEAL WITH THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE
"CONTRAS" STATIONED IN HONDURAS.

   ORTEGA RECALLED THAT THE UNITED STATES FINANCES THE "CONTRAS" AND
THEREFORE WASHINGTON HAS IN ITS HANDS [THE POSSIBILITY] OF
"GIVING SOME TRANQUILITY TO THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE."

   "THIS IS NOW A DEMAND OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEOPLES, WHICH WAS
RATIFIED AT THE (COSTA RICA) MEETING," ORTEGA ADDED.

   ORTEGA RECALLED THAT THE DEADLINE TO DEMOBILIZE THE REBELS ENDED ON
5 DECEMBER AND THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S ATTITUDE WAS TO OPPOSE THE
DISBANDING OF THE "CONTRAS."

   ORTEGA STATED: "THUS, I BELIEVE IT IS NECESSARY THAT THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT RESPECT THE AGREEMENTS AND STOP DISRESPECTING THE RESOLVE
OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AND PEOPLES WHO WANT PEACE."

   ORTEGA TRUSTS THAT WITH THE UN SUPPORT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
WILL MAKE EFFORTS TO PROMOTE THE DEMOBILIZATION OF APPROXIMATELY
12,000 CONTRAS STATIONED IN HONDURAS, AS WELL AS THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN
THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLA MOVEMENT TO SEEK A
SOLUTION TO AN OVER 10-YEAR-LONG WAR.

   ORTEGA ADMITTED THAT HE GETS WORRIED EVERY TIME HE ATTENDS A
SUMMIT, BECAUSE THESE MEETINGS "ARE HELD UNDER U.S. PRESSURE," BUT
FINALLY "WE REACHED AGREEMENTS THAT STRENGTHEN THE PEACE PROCESS."

   ACCORDING TO ORTEGA, THE PEACE PLANS SIGNED BY THE AREA PRESIDENTS
"HAVE HAD A GOOD EFFECT IN NICARAGUA," BUT HE WARNED THAT HE COULD NOT
SAY THE SAME FOR EL SALVADOR, "WITH WHICH WE CANNOT BE PLEASED YET."

DEV-MUC3-0980 (SRI)

   BOGOTA, 12 DEC 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] BRITISH ENGINEER JOHN MARCK JONES
[NAME AS RECEIVED], KIDNAPPED BY THE MARXIST-LENINIST NATIONAL
LIBERATION ARMY [ELN], RESIDES IN COLOMBIA AND BOTH HIS WIFE AND TWO
CHILDREN ARE COLOMBIANS, IT WAS OFICIALLY REPORTED TODAY.

   JONES, 45, WHO WAS REPORTED MISSING IN ARAUCA DEPARTMENT IN
COLOMBIA'S NORTHEAST EARLY ON 11 DECEMBER, IS THE OWNER OF ALTA
TENSION DE COLOMBIA, A POWER COMPANY.

   JONES' RELATIVES TOLD THE LOCAL PRESS THAT, DESPITE THE INITIAL
REPORTS, THE BRITISH ENGINEER DOES NOT WORK FOR A MULTINATIONAL
CORPORATION.

   IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE ELN MISTOOK HIM FOR THE EMPLOYEE OF SOME
FOREIGN COMPANY AND THAT THEY MIGHT BE PLANNING TO DEMAND A RANSOM.

   JONES WAS TAKEN IN A MOUNTAINOUS AREA OF THE CATATUMBO OIL BASIN,
NEAR THE BORDER WITH VENEZUELA, WHILE DRIVING WITH TWO FELLOW WORKERS,
WHO WERE NOT DETAINED.

   THESE MEN TOLD THE COLOMBIAN POLICE THAT THE KIDNAPPERS IDENTIFIED
THEMSELVES AS ELN MEMBERS AND THAT THEY TOOK THE ENGINEER WHEN THEY
CONFIRMED HE WAS A FOREIGNER.

   JONES' POWER COMPANY BUILDS POWER SUBSTATIONS IN OIL CAMPS IN THE
AREA WHERE HE WAS KIDNAPPED.

   A POLICE SOURCE TOLD EFE THAT A SPECIALIZED AGENCY, WHICH IS
INVESTIGATING THE KIDNAPPING, IS TRYING TO DETERMINE THE ENGINEER'S
WHEREABOUTS.

   THE ELN HAS A LONG HISTORY OF KIDNAPPINGS AND EXTORTION AGAINST OIL
GROUPS, BOARD OF DIRECTORS MEMBERS, AND ENGINEERS.

DEV-MUC3-0983 (SRI)

   HAVANA (CUBA), 13 DEC 89 (INTERNATIONAL SERVICE) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
SALVADORAN RICARDO MONTENEGRO, MEMBER OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN "RADIO VENCEREMOS INTERNATIONAL SERVICE," BY
JORGE LUIS BERNARD] [TEXT] [BERNARD] MONTENEGRO, WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
IF THE THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] WILL
CONTINUE WITH THE CURRENT MILITARY OFFENSIVE THAT BEGAN ON 11 NOVEMBER
SINCE THE AGREEMENT AMONG THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS WAS SIGNED?

   [MONTENEGRO] THE TRUTH IS THAT THE REASONS WHY THE FMLN BEGAN ITS
OFFENSIVE ON 11 NOVEMBER 1989 HAVE NOT CHANGED AT ALL.  THUS, THE FMLN
CANNOT STOP ITS OFFENSIVE.  ON THE CONTRARY, WHAT HAPPENED IN EL
SALVADOR IS THAT THE FMLN OFFENSIVE STRATEGICALLY TURNED THE WAR.
THAT TURN INCLUDED A NUMBER OF MILITARY, POLITICAL, AND DIPLOMATIC
IMPLICATIONS.

   THUS, THE TRUTH IS THAT THE AGREEMENT SIGNED IN SAN ISIDRO DE
CORONADO DID NOT PROPOSE REALISTIC NEGOTIATIONS FOR THE CONFLICT.
YESTERDAY, 12 DECEMBER, THE FMLN ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE WHICH VEHEMENTLY
EXPRESSED ITS ABSOLUTE REJECTION OF THE AGREEMENT SIGNED AT THE
PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT.  AT PRESENT, THE FMLN BELIEVES THAT DESPITE WHAT
THE OTHER FOUR CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS SAY, IT IS CLEARER THAN
EVER THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS A FASCIST, MILITARY
DICTATORSHIP.  THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT VIOLATES PEOPLE'S HUMAN
RIGHTS AND THAT FACT HAS BEEN CLEARLY PROVED TO THE ENTIRE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  THEREFORE, ANY ATTEMPT TO HELP THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT OR ANY KIND OF SUPPORT GIVEN TO IT NOTHING BUT A
PIECE OF PAPER THAT DOES NOT HAVE TOO MUCH VALIDITY TO THE FMLN.

   [BERNARD] IN OTHER WORDS COMRADE, THE FMLN WILL MAINTAIN THE SAME
LEVEL OF CONFRONTATION WITH THE DICTATORSHIP?

   [MONTENEGRO] I BELIEVE THE FMLN'S ARMED STRUGGLE IS NOW MORE
LEGITIMATE THAN EVER.  THE SUMMIT CONFIRMED THE LEGITIMACY OF THE
FMLN'S STRUGGLE, BECAUSE THE AGREEMENT RESULTING FROM THAT SUMMIT IS
NEITHER FEASIBLE NOR REAL.  THE FMLN WILL THEREFORE CONTINUE ITS
POLITICAL - MILITARY OFFENSIVE.  THE FMLN WILL INCREASE ITS ACTIONS.
THE FMLN IS REORGANIZING [READECUAR] ITS POLITICAL - MILITARY
APPARATUS.  IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS, WE WILL CLEARLY SHOW WHAT THE FMLN
CAN DO.  THE FMLN WILL NOT SURRENDER ITS WEAPONS, ESPECIALLY NOW.  THE
FMLN HAS NO OBLIGATION TO ABIDE BY AN AGREEMENT THAT DOES NOT REFLECT
THE SALVADORAN REALITY AT ALL.

   IF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS CHOSE TO CLOSE THEIR EYES TO
WHAT IS GOING ON THAT IS REALLY THEIR PROBLEM.

   [BERNARD] TWO DAYS AFTER THE END OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN SUMMIT,
WHAT IS THE CURRENT MILITARY SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR?

   [MONTENEGRO] AS I TOLD YOU EARLIER IN ANSWERING THE FIRST QUESTION,
THE FIRST THING IS THAT THE FMLN DEFINATELY CHANGED THE WAR.  THIS
MEANS THAT THE FMLN MADE THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES RETREAT FROM THE
MOUNTAINS TO THE HEART OF THE CITIES INCLUDING THE CAPITAL CITY OF SAN
SALVADOR.

   AT PRESENT, WE HAVE ALMOST ABSOLUTE CONTROL OVER THE HIGHWAYS IN
14, I MEAN 12 SALVADORAN DEPARTMENTS.  THERE HAVE BEEN ACTIONS IN
AHUACHAPAN AND SONSONATE, TWO DEPARTMENTS THAT HAD BEEN ALMOST
UNTOUCHED BY THE WAR.

   THERE IS A STRATEGIC SIEGE IN SAN SALVADOR.  THE ARMY HAS 65
PERCENT OF ITS FORCES STATIONED IN SAN SALVADOR.  THE ARMY HAS
ABANDONED LARGE AREAS.

   AS FOR SABOTAGE OPERATIONS, AT PRESENT THERE ARE 10 110,000-VOLT
PRIMARY LINES THAT ARE OUT OF SERVICE.  THAT REPRESENTS A 40-PERCENT
ENERGY DEFICIT IN THE COUNTRY.  THERE HAVE BEEN LONG PERIODS OF
100-PERCENT POWER OUTAGES IN SAN SALVADOR.  IT IS VERY UNLIKELY THAT
THE GOVERNMENT CAN CONTROL THAT SITUATION.  WE DO NOT KNOW HOW LONG
THEY WILL ENDURE IT.  BUT IN ANY CASE, A STRONG BLOW BY THE FMLN

   SAN SALVADOR, 13 DEC 89 (LA PRENSA GRAFICA) -- [TEXT] MARIA JULIO
HERNANDEZ, DIRECTOR OF THE LEGAL ASSISTANCE OFFICE OF THE ARCHBISHOPRIC, IS
THE ONE WHO BRAINWASHED THE WITNESS OF THE MURDER OF THE SIX JESUITS AND TWO
WOMEN.

   THE PREVIOUS STATEMENT WAS MADE ON 12 DECEMBER BY COLONEL ORLANDO
INOCENTE MONTANO DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE AT THE DEFENSE MINISTRY TO
THE LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL REPORTERS.

   THE WITNESS OF THE MASSACRE, LUCIA BARRERA DE CERNA, WAS TAKEN TO
THE UNITED STATES WHERE SHE UNDERWENT INTERROGATIONS BY THE FEDERAL
BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION [FBI].

   THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS VERY INTERESTED IN THE THOROUGH
INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE BEING CONDUCTED BY THE SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC
INVESTIGATION FORCES OF SPAIN, THE U.S. FBI, AND SCOTLAND YARD OF
ENGLAND.

   ACCORDING TO A WASHINGTON DATELINE ITEM TRANSMITTED ON 11 DECEMBER
BY THE UPI NEWS AGENCY, SAN SALVADOR ARCHBISHOP MSGR ARTURO RIVERA Y

CERNA, THE ONLY WITNESS IN THE MURDER OF THE SIX JESUITS AND TWO
EMPLOYEES.

   ACCORDING TO THE FBI INVESTIGATIONS, THE WITNESS HAS CHANGED HER
STORY THREE TIMES; THIS WAS DETERMINED BY A LIE DETECTOR TEST.

DEV-MUC3-0987 (SRI)

   SANTIAGO, 14 DEC 89 (RADIO CHILENA NETWORK) -- [TEXT] PRESIDENT PINOCHET
HAS BRANDED FOREIGN JOURNALISTS AS INTRUDERS.  THE HEAD OF STATE WAS CLEARLY
UPSET BY THE PRESENCE OF INTERNATIONAL JOURNALISTS AND OBSERVERS WHEN HE
WENT TO VOTE.

   JOURNALIST ELIANA HENRIQUEZ WILL NOW GIVE US MORE DETAILS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [HENRIQUEZ] GOOD AFTERNOON.  PRESIDENT AUGUSTO
PINOCHET THIS MORNING LEFT THE HIGHER INSTITUTE OF COMMERCE WHERE HE
WENT TO VOTE, ANGRY WITH CHILEANS AND CLEARLY UPSET BY THE PRESENCE OF
INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS AND JOURNALISTS.  THE HEAD OF STATE WALKED
FROM THE LA MONEDA PALACE TO THE HIGHER INSTITUTE OF COMMERCE, WHICH
IS AT THE INTERSECTION OF AMUNATEGUI AND MONEDA STREETS.  HE WAS
ACCOMPANIED BY THE INTERIOR MINISTER, THE MINISTER SECRETARY GENERAL
OF GOVERNMENT, THE PRESIDENTIAL GENERAL SECRETARY, AND THE CHIEF OF
THE MILITARY HOUSEHOLD.  HE GREETED GENERAL CARLOS PARERA, THE
MILITARY COMMANDER OF THE METROPOLITAN REGION, AND THE SANTIAGO MAYOR.
PINOCHET THEN WENT TO VOTING TABLE NO 1 WHERE HE WAS SCHEDULED TO
VOTE.  HE SAW DOZENS OF FOREIGN TELEVISION CAMERAMEN, PHOTOGRAPHERS,
AND JOURNALISTS.

   BEFORE ENTERING THE VOTING BOOTH, PINOCHET SAID HE WAS IN VERY GOOD
SPIRITS AND VERY HAPPY.

   AFTER VOTING, PINOCHET SAID HE WAS VERY SATISFIED BECAUSE THIS
MEANT THE END OF THE MISSION HE BEGAN ON 11 SEPTEMBER 1973.  HE ADDED
THAT HE EXPECTED THE ELECTION TO DEVELOP AS CALMLY AS USUAL.  WHEN A
U.S. NEWSWOMAN APPROACHED HIM FOR AN INTERVIEW, PINOCHET, IRRITATED,
ASKED HER WHAT SHE WAS DOING PUTTING HER NOSE IN HERE; HE TOLD HER
THAT THIS IS OUR PROBLEM, NOT YOURS, INTRUDERS.  PINOCHET THEN TURNED
TO THE LOCAL NEWSMEN AND TOLD THEM THAT HE IS UNHAPPY WITH CHILEANS
FOR ALLOWING FOREIGN OBSERVERS TO ENTER THE COUNTRY.

   [PINOCHET] I AM UNHAPPY WITH CHILEANS BECAUSE THEY HAVE LOST THEIR
FEELING OF NATIONALITY BY ACCEPTING THE PRESENCE OF A BUNCH OF
OUTSIDERS WHO HAVE COME TO LOOK OVER WHAT WE ARE DOING.  WHAT DO THEY
THINK THEY ARE DOING?  LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE: THESE OUTSIDERS
ARE HERE TO CHECK ON THE WAY IN WHICH THEIR MONEY HAS BEEN INVESTED BY
THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND THESE GENTLEMEN [A REFERENCE TO OPPOSITION
CANDIDATES IN GENERAL].

   [HENRIQUEZ] AS HE WAS LEAVING THE VOTING SITE, PINOCHET TOLD A
URUGUAYAN CORRESPONDENT THAT THE OBSERVERS ARE INTRUDERS.

   INTERIOR MINISTER CARLOS CACERES AFFIRMED THAT THE SITUATION AROUND
THE COUNTRY REMAINS NORMAL AND ORDERLY.  HE ADDED THAT THE ONLY
INCIDENT WAS THE BOMB EXPLOSION AT THE EL SALVADORAN EMBASSY AND A
MINOR INCIDENT THAT TOOK PLACE THIS MORNING IN THE LOCALITY OF MARIA
PINTO.  CACERES SAID THAT HE WILL REMAIN ALL DAY AT THE LA MONEDA
PALACE IN ORDER TO BRIEF PRESIDENT PINOCHET ON THE VOTING PROCEEDINGS
AND ANY SECURITY PROBLEM THAT MIGHT ARISE.

   FINALLY, HE SAID THAT THE HEAD OF STATE WILL ALSO STAY IN HIS
OFFICE.  THIS AFTERNOON PINOCHET WILL PROBABLY VISIT THE VOTE COUNTING
CENTER OF THE INTERIOR MINISTRY ON MONATEGUI STREET.  GOOD AFTERNOON.
[END RECORDING]

DEV-MUC3-0989 (SRI)

   SANTIAGO, 15 DEC 89 (TELEVISION NACIONAL DE CHILE NETWORK) --
[COMMUNIQUE] [TEXT] GOOD EVENING. THE GOVERNMENT HAS ANNOUNCED A MAJOR
PORTION OF THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTIONS HELD TODAY.  AFTER 93 PERCENT
OF THE VOTING STATIONS HAVE BEEN COUNTED, AND WHEN ALL THAT IS NEEDED
IS THE OFFICIAL REPORT OF THE ELECTORAL COURT, IT IS POSSIBLE TO SAY
THAT PATRICIO AYLWIN AZOCAR HAS BEEN ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC
FOR THE L990-L994 TERM.

   WITH REGARD TO THAT RESULT THE SUPREME GOVERNMENT WOULD LIKE TO
CONVEY TO THE PEOPLE THE FOLLOWING:

   1. ALL CHILEANS SHOULD BE PROUD FOR ONCE AGAIN PARTICIPATING IN AN
EXEMPLARY ELECTION.

   2. ON BEHALF OF THE SUPREME GOVERNMENT, I WOULD LIKE TO CONVEY A
DESERVED RECOGNITION TO THE ARMED FORCES AND CARABINEROS, WHO HAVE LED
AN ELECTORAL PROCESS IN ORDER AND TRANQUILITY, AND TO ALL THE PEOPLE
WHO PARTICIPATED TODAY AT THE VOTING STATIONS. THEY ENABLED THIS
ELECTION TO BE HELD IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF PEACE, AND THEREBY ALLOWED
THE FREE EXPRESSION OF CIVIC WILL.  WE MUST, HOWEVER, REPUDIATE THE
VIOLENT MURDER OF A MEMBER OF CARABINEROS.

   3. THE PEOPLE MUST REST ASSURED THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT
PINOCHET, FAITHFUL TO THE COMMITMENT MADE WITH THE ARMED FORCES AND
POLICE, WILL HAVE THE RESULTS OF THE RECENT ELECTIONS RESPECTED.  THE
GOVERNMENT CALLS ON THE ENTIRE COUNTRY TO MAINTAIN PUBLIC ORDER, AND
TO WAIT WITH TRANQUILITY THE FINAL RESULTS OF THIS ELECTION.

   4. DURING THE LAST 16 YEARS CHILE HAS MOVED AHEAD SYSTEMATICALLY
AND WITHOUT HESITATION TOWARD THE GREAT OBJECTIVES SET FORTH AT THE
BEGINNING OF THE MILITARY GOVERNMENT.  THE GOVERNMENT IS FULLY
SATISFIED WITH THE WORK OF DEMOCRATIC, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL
RECONSTRUCTION THAT WAS CARRIED OUT BY ALL CHILEANS UNDER THE
LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT PINOCHET.  WE HAVE SET FORTH A SOLID BASIS FOR
FUTURE PROSPERITY.

   5. THIS ELECTION FULFILLED ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS
FOR REACHING THE FULL DEMOCRACY THAT WAS DESTROYED IN THE PAST BY THE
ENEMIES OF FREEDOM AND PLURALISM.  AS HIS EXCELLENCY PRESIDENT
PINOCHET SAID, 11 SEPTEMBER L973 NOT ONLY REPRESENTED THE OVERTHROW OF
AN ILLEGIMATE AND FAILED GOVERNMENT, BUT IT ALSO REPRESENTED THE END
OF A WORN OUT POLITICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL REGIME, AND THE NEED TO
BUILD A NEW ONE.  IT WAS NOT JUST A TASK OF SIMPLE RESTORATION, BUT
PRIMARILY A CREATIVE TASK WHICH, IN ORDER TO SUCCEED, HAD TO BE
CARRIED OUT IN THE DEEP ROOTS OF NATIONAL TRADITION.

   6. THE ARMED FORCES AND CARABINEROS FULFILLED THE COMMITMENT MADE
IN SEPTEMBER L973.  THE MISSION HAS BEEN FULFILLED.  AUTHENTIC
DEMOCRACY AS A WAY OF LIFE AND A FORM OF GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN CREATED,
AND THE TRANSITION PROCESS ENDS ON 11 MARCH L990.  FROM NOW ON IT WILL
BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EVERY CHILEAN TO KEEP WATCH SO THAT THE
STABILITY AND PROGRESS ACHIEVED WITH POLITICAL WILL AND CONSTANT
EFFORT WILL CONTINUE TO PREVAIL IN OUR FREE SOCIETY. THANK YOU VERY
MUCH. GOOD NIGHT.

DEV-MUC3-0998 (SRI)

   SAN SALVADOR, 15 DEC 89 (TCS TELEVISION) -- [TEXT] YESTERDAY, MARIA JULIA
HERNANADEZ, DIRECTOR OF THE ARCHBISHOPRIC LEGAL ASSITANCE OFFICE, MADE
OFFICIAL STATEMENTS BEFORE THE COURT REGARDING THE MURDER OF THE UCA
[CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY] PRIESTS.

   IN RESPONSE TO A REQUEST ISSUED BY THE SALVADORAN 4TH CRIMINAL
COURT, MARIA JULIA HERNANDEZ MADE STATEMENTS BEFORE THE COURT
REGARDING THE MURDER OF SIX UCA JESUIT PRIESTS.  THE PRIESTS WERE
KILLED ON 16 NOVEMBER.

   ACCORDING TO HERNANDEZ, HER STATEMENT WAS PERSONAL AND SHE LIMITED
HERSELF TO REPORTING ON THE INVESTIGATIONS SHE CONDUCTED AT UCA AFTER
THE MURDER.  IN HER STATEMENT, HERNANDEZ SAID THAT SHE FOUND FOUR
BULLET CASINGS INSIDE UCA.  THE PROSECUTORS THEN ALLEGED THAT SHE HAD
COMMITTED A CRIME BY PICKING UP EVIDENCE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [HERNANDEZ] I MADE PERSONAL STATEMENTS AS A
WITNESS. I TOLD THEM WHAT I SAW AND HEARD AT THE SITE OF THE CRIME.
THAT IS WHAT I DID.  THE PROSECUTORS ASKED ME ABOUT THE EVIDENCE I HAD
GATHERED AT THE SITE OF THE CRIME.  I PICKED UP FOUR BULLET CASINGS.
THE PROSECUTORS SAID I HAD COMMITTED A CRIME.  THAT IS, THEREFORE, THE
CRIME I COMMITTED.  [END RECORDING]

   ALTHOUGH SHE DID NOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT FACTS TO FORMULATE AN
OPINION, HERNANDEZ SAID THAT AS AN INSTITUTION, THE ARCHBISHOPRIC
LEGAL ASSISTANCE OFFICE BELIEVES THAT THE EVIDENCE, WHICH SHE DID NOT
MENTION, INDICATES THAT ARMED FORCES MEMBERS, WHO REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED,
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MURDER OF THE JESUITS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [HERNANDEZ] THE CHURCH ALREADY ISSUED ITS
OFFICIAL DOCUMENT CLEARLY STATING THAT THERE ARE ARMED FORCES MEMBERS
INVOLVED IN THE MURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS.

   [REPORTER] ON WHAT DOES THE CHURCH BASE THAT ASSERTION?

   [HERNANDEZ] ON THE INVESTIGATIONS CONDUCTED BY THE ARCHBISHOPRIC
LEGAL ASSISTANCE OFFICE.

   [REPORTER] YES, BUT WHAT PROOF DOES THE CHURCH HAVE TO MAKE THAT
ASSERTION?

   [HERNANDEZ] ALL THAT IS CONTAINED IN THE CHURCH DOCUMENT THAT WAS
ALREADY RELEASED.  YOU CAN GET THAT DOCUMENT IF YOU WANT.  [END
RECORDING]

   IN ADDITION, MARIA JULIA HERNANDEZ DENIED STATEMENTS MADE BY SOME
MILITARY CHIEFS WHO SAID THAT WITNESS LUCIA CERNA, WHO IS OUT OF THE
COUNTRY, WAS NEVER MANIPULATED OR PRESSURED.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [HERNANDEZ] I WAS INTRODUCED TO MRS CERNA BY THE
HEAD OF THE PROVINCIAL JESUIT ORDER ON MONDAY, 20 NOVEMBER.  IN FRONT
OF HIM, MRS CERNA MADE HER STATEMENT.  AND SHE MADE THAT SAME
STATEMENT BEFORE THE JUDGE AND THE PROSECUTORS AT THE SPANISH EMBASSY.
THEY ARE WITNESSES TO THOSE STATEMENTS.

   IN OTHER WORDS, SHE MADE THE STATEMENT AT THE SPANISH EMBASSY
BEFORE I MET HER.  I COULD NOT HAVE MANIPULATED HER AT ALL.  [END
RECORDING]

   THE 4TH CRIMINAL COURT PROCEDURES REGARDING THIS CASE WILL CONTINUE
IN ORDER TO TRY TO CLARIFY THE DEATH OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS INCLUDING
IGNACIO ELLACURIA.  CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADER FIDEL CHAVEZ
MENA AND SAN SALVADOR AUXILIARY BISHOP MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ STILL
HAVE TO MAKE THEIR STATEMENTS BEFORE THE COURT.

DEV-MUC3-1005 (TRW)

   BOGOTA, 16 DEC 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [REPORT]
[PATRICIA JARAMILLO] [TEXT] AN ELITE NATIONAL POLICE FORCE, SPECIALLY
TRAINED FOR THIS TYPE OF COMMANDO ACTION, CARRIED OUT THE OPERATION IN
WHICH GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA WAS KILLED.  THE SPECIAL ARMED CORPS
[CUERPO ESPECIAL ARMADO], CEA, WAS ESTABLISHED BY DECREE NO 814 OF 19
APRIL 1989.  THIS CORPS IS MORE COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE ELITE FORCE.

   THE GROUP WAS INITIALLY FORMED BY 250 QUALIFIED POLICEMEN AND WAS
GIVEN RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DEATH SQUADS, BANDS OF
PAID ASSASSINS, AND SELF-DEFENSE OR PRIVATE VIGILANTE GROUPS THAT ARE
SOMETIMES CALLED PARAMILITARY GROUPS.  THE ANTI-TERRORIST FORCE
MEMBERS WERE TRAINED AT THE POLICE NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS ACADEMY
LOCATED IN A MOUNTAINOUS REGION IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF BOGOTA FOR 3
MONTHS. LATER ON, THESE MEN WERE SENT TO DIFFERENT AREAS WITHIN THE
COUNTRY, ESPECIALLY IN ANTIOQUIA.

   THE ELITE FORCES STARTED TO WORK ON 2 MAY, AND RESULTS APPEARED VERY SOON
AFTER THAT.  THE CEA UNDERTOOK AN OPERATION NAMED RAINBOW [ARCOIRIS] AND
DISMANTLED 10 COCAINE PROCESSING LABORATORIES IN THE MID-MAGADALENA REGION
IN LESS THAN 8 DAYS.  GENERAL BENJAMIN FRANKLIN LOST HIS LIFE DURING THIS
OPERATION.  LATER ON THEY ALSO DISMANTLED AN ASSASSIN TRAINING SCHOOL AT
META, DESTROYED CLANDESTINE AIRPORTS, AND ABORTED A TERRORIST PLAN IN
CARTAGENA THAT INCLUDED DYNAMITING ITS NAVAL BASE, MAIN INDUSTRIES, AND CAIS
[IMMEDIATE ATTENTION CENTERS].  AFTER LUIS CARLOS GALAN WAS KILLED, THE
ELITE FORCES HELD TWO BIG OPERATIONS IN YACOPI, THE RIO NEGRO REGION WHERE
RODRIGUEZ GACHA ESTABLISHED SELF-DEFENSE GROUPS.  THE OPERATIVES HAD THE
OBJECTIVE OF CAPTURING RODRIGUEZ GACHA BUT HE MANAGED TO ESCAPE.  THE SPECIAL
FORCES ALSO CONDUCTED AN OPERATION AT COCORNAC IN AN ATTEMPT TO CAPTURE
PABLO ESCOBAR BUT HE ALSO MANAGED TO ESCAPE.  THE BLOW DELIVERED BY THE
ELITE FORCES YESTERDAY, IN WHICH THE MEXICANO [GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA]
FELL, WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITH HARD INTELLIGENCE, INVESTIGATION, AND ESPIONAGE
WORK.  HERE IS WHAT POLICE DIRECTOR MAJOR GENERAL MIGUEL GOMEZ HAS TO SAY:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [GOMEZ] WE ARE VERY SATISFIED TO HAVE ACCOMPLISHED
OUR MISSION.  OUR INSTITUTION HAS RESPONDED TO THE DEMANDS OF THE
COUNTRY.  WE ARE HELPING COLOMBIA RID ITSELF OF ALL FORMS OF VIOLENCE
GENERATED BY THESE CRIMINALS.  [END RECORDING]

   THE ELITE FORCES WILL CONTINUE ITS WORK WITH 1,000 MEN, 17
HELICOPTERS, THE ADVISE OF BRITISH AND ITALIAN EXPERTS, AND THE UNITED
STATES' ECONOMIC AND LOGISTICAL AID.

DEV-MUC3-1008 (TRW)

   BOGOTA, 8 DEC 89 (EL SIGLO) -- [TEXT] THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY [PCC]
CENTRAL COMMITTEE HAS ISSUED A STATEMENT CONDEMNING THE RECENT ATTACK
AGAINST THE INSTALLATIONS OF THE DAS [ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY]
AND EXPRESSING SOLIDARITY WITH DAS GENERAL DIRECTOR GENERAL ALFREDO MAZA
MARQUEZ.

   THE PCC LEADERSHIP NOTES THAT ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS IT HAS ENDORSED
GEN MAZA'S STATEMENTS, WHICH ARE "CANDID, COURAGEOUS, AND SHED LIGHT
ON THE NEFARIOUS ROLE CERTAIN GROUPS IN THE ARMY AND POLICE LEADERSHIP
HAVE PLAYED IN HELPING ORGANIZE BANDS OF HIRED KILLERS AND THEIR
UNPATRIOTIC EFFORTS AS GO-BETWEENS IN HIRING MERCENARIES WHO TRAIN THE
FASCIST BANDS AND MURDER COLOMBIANS."

   THE PCC CENTRAL COMMITTEE ADDS THAT:

   "THE MEASURES AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING THAT HAVE BEEN ENACTED BY
PRESIDENT BARCO'S ADMINISTRATION WILL BE INEFFECTIVE UNLESS THE ARMY'
UPPER ECHELON IS REORGANIZED IMMEDIATELY AND PURGED OF ITS CORRUPT
ELEMENTS.  ONLY IN THIS WAY WILL THE "ELITE FORCE" BE PREVENTED FROM
CONTINUING TO CARRY OUT GANGSTER-STYLE ASSAULTS AND BE MADE TO GEAR
ITS ACTIONS TOWARD THE GROUPS WHICH ARE REALLY DESTABILIZING THE
DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES THROUGH CRIME AND BRIBERY; THAT IS, THE
PARAMILITARY GROUPS THAT ARE OPERATING IN THE MIDDLE MAGDALENA REGION,
META, CAQUETA, CORDOBA, THE URABA AREA IN ANTIOQUIA, AND IN OTHER
PLACES, AS GEN MAZA HAS REPORTED WITH SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE."

DEV-MUC3-1010 (TRW)

   CLANDESTINE, 12 DEC 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [INTERVIEW WITH LEO
CABRAL, FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) COMMANDER, BY
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [REPORTER] THE FIRST QUESTION WE ASK
COMRADE LEO CABRAL IS: WHAT ARE THE RESULTS OF THE OFFENSIVE AFTER 1
MONTH?

   [CABRAL] TODAY, 11 DECEMBER, AFTER 1 MONTH OF A GLORIOUS AND
VICTORIOUS OFFENSIVE, WE HAVE SOME THOUGHTS REGARDING THIS LATEST
FIGHT.  WE WANT TO STRESS THAT ALL OUR OFFENSIVES HAVE CENTERED AROUND
THE MAIN CITIES IN OUR COUNTRY.  ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND
SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENTS OF THIS STRUGGLE BY THE PEOPLE AND THE FMLN
IS HAVING MAINTAINED THE BESIEGEMENT ON THE MOST IMPORTANT POLITICAL
AND ECONOMIC POINTS, MOST ESPECIALLY ON THE COUNTRY'S CAPITAL.  THERE
HAS BEEN GREAT PRESSURE IN THE CASE OF SAN SALVADOR, AND THE FMLN HAS
FORCED THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, COLONEL PONCE, AND THE FASCIST HIGH
COMMAND TO CHANGE THEIR STRATEGIC TACTICS THREE TIMES.

   YOU WILL RECALL THAT THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF FIRST TRIED TO
DISLODGE THE FMLN FORCES THAT HAD ENTERED SINCE THE EVENING OF 11
NOVEMBER.  WHEN THE FIRST PUPPET ARMY STRATEGIC DEFENSE TACTIC FAILED,
THEY THEN TRIED TO ISOLATE THE FMLN FORCES FROM ONE ANOTHER AND
ANNIHILATE THEM ONE BY ONE.  FOR THIS, THEY CONCENTRATED SPECIAL
FORCES, ESPECIALLY USING ELITE BATTALIONS, IN A SIEGE MODALITY FOR
ANNIHILATION.  THIS ALSO FAILED.  FACED WITH THE SECOND FAILURE OF
THEIR SPECIAL TACTICS TO END THE OFFENSIVE IN A FEW DAYS, AS CRISTIANI
AND THE HIGH MILITARY COMMAND HAD SAID, THEY MOVED A GREAT NUMBER OF
OPERATIONAL FORCES FROM THE COUNTRY'S INTERIOR, SUCH AS THE ELITE
BATTALIONS, TO SET UP AN EXTENSIVE SIEGE TO DEFEND THE CAPITAL CITY
AND PREVENT OUR FORCES FROM ENTERING IT.  AS ALL OUR PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
ABLE TO SEE -- AND INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION HAS ALSO BEEN ABLE TO
VERIFY THIS THROUGH A GREAT AMOUNT OF INFORMATION FLOWING THROUGH
INTERNATIONAL REPORTERS -- THAT SIEGE TO KEEP OUT THE FMLN HAS ALSO
FAILED.  THIS MEANS MORE VICTORIES AND SUCCESSES, SUCH AS INCURSIONS
INTO THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE SOUTHERN AREA OF ANTIGUO
CUSCATLAN, AND TWO IMPORTANT ATTACKS ON THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF.

   RIGHT NOW WE SEE THAT THE PUPPET ARMY'S SPECIAL CITY OPERATION IS
THEIR THIRD AND LAST PLAN.  THEY HAVE FORMED FOUR COMMANDS TO CONTROL
THE CITY, WHICH WILL ALSO BE DEFEATED BY OUR FMLN MILITARY FORCES.  WE
ALSO MUST ADD TO THIS LIST OF ACHIEVEMENTS THAT THE GREAT
CONCENTRATION OF ENEMY ARMY OPERATIONAL FORCES IN THE CAPITAL HAS
CAUSED A GREAT NATIONAL IMBALANCE IN FORCES.  THIS MEANS THAT
EXTENSIVE AREAS OF THE COUNTRY ARE WITHOUT THE PROTECTION OF THE
PUPPET TROOPS.  WE HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THIS AND HAVE WORKED ON
ORGANIZING THE PEOPLE AND RAISING A PEOPLE'S POWER, AN ALTERNATIVE TO
LOCAL REACTIONARY POWER.

   WE ALSO RECORD AS A SUCCESSFUL OFFENSIVE DURING THIS FIRST MONTH
THE FACT THAT OUR ENEMY'S INTELLIGENCE WORK HAS BEEN COMPLETELY
SMASHED.  THE SEARCHES, WHICH HAVE BEEN ENTRUSTED IN AN IMPROVISED
MANNER TO MILITARY TROOPS CONCENTRATED IN THE CITIES, ESPECIALLY THE
REPRESSIVE CORPS, HAVE ATTEMPTED TO RESTORE ALL THE INTELLIGENCE DATA
BANKS TO BE ABLE TO TRY AND DESTROY THE PEOPLE'S STRUGGLE.  WE MUST
ALSO RECORD AS ONE OF THE SUCCESSES OF OUR GENERAL OFFENSIVE DURING
THIS FIRST MONTH THE FACT THAT THE PUPPET ARMY WAS FORCED TO ABORT
ANOTHER PLAN.  EVEN THOUGH THERE WERE SOME BLOODY EVENTS, SUCH AS THE
MURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, ALONG WITH A GREAT AMOUNT OF KIDNAPPINGS
AND MISSING PEOPLE AND ARRESTS OF MEMBERS OR LEADERS OF GRASSROOT
PEOPLE'S MOVEMENTS, WE FEEL THAT THE ARMY AND REPRESSIVE CORPS ARE
INCAPABLE OF ATTENDING TO THE FMLN OFFENSIVE AND THE BESIEGEMENT AT
THE SAME TIME THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO CARRY OUT THEIR ANNIHILATION OF
THE PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT.  SO THIS IS ANOTHER SUCCESS.  [CONTINUED]

DEV-MUC3-1013 (TRW)

   SAN SALVADOR, 19 DEC 89 (TCS TELEVISION) -- [TEXT] A FEW MONTHS AGO, IT
WAS SPECULATED THAT CHANGES OF COMMAND IN CERTAIN ARMED FORCES KEY POSTS
WOULD TAKE PLACE LATE IN 1989.

   COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, JOINT CHIEF OF STAFF, DISREGARDED THIS
POSSIBILITY AND SAID THAT THE SITUATION OF VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY,
PARTICULARLY SINCE THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT]
OFFENSIVE, REQUIRES, MORE THAN EVER, THAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE MILITARILY
STABLE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] I THINK THE SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY
DEMANDS MILITARY STABILITY.  CHANGES COULD PROVOKE SOME UNREST.  WE
THINK NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE MILITARY COMMAND SHOULD BE MADE AT
PRESENT BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT SITUATION.  SHOULD ANY CHANGES BE MADE,
IT WOULD BE FOR MAJOR REASONS IN THE SERVICE. NO HIGH-LEVEL CHANGES
HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATED, HOWEVER. [END RECORDING]

   REFERRING TO THE REBELS' ACTIVITIES, COL PONCE SAID THE ARMED
ACTIONS INITIATED, PARTICULARLY IN SAN SALVADOR ON 11 NOVEMBER, HAVE
ENDED WITH UNFAVORABLE RESULTS FOR THE GUERRILLAS.  HE ADVISED,
HOWEVER, THAT THE GUERRILLAS WILL CONTINUE TO SABOTAGE THE COUNTRY'S
ECONOMY AND PERPETRATE TERRORIST ACTIONS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE FMLN HAS FAILED,
MILITARILY SPEAKING.  THE FMLN'S FAMOUS ALL - THE - WAY OFFENSIVE HAS
ENDED IN TREMENDOUS FAILURE, DETERMINED BY THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  WE
CAN ANTICIPATE THAT THE FMLN WILL CONTINUE ITS SABOTAGING ACTIONS AND
TERRORISM WHICH COULD DESTROY STORES IN SAN SALVADOR, AS WELL AS POSTS
AND PYLONS ON HIGHWAYS. THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE CAN REST ASSURED,
HOWEVER, THAT AN OFFENSIVE ACTION BY THE FMLN AT PRESENT CAN BE
DISREGARDED. [END RECORDING]

   REGARDING THE CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR FESTIVITIES, WHICH HAVE BEEN
MARRED BY THE WAVE OF VIOLENCE, MANY PEOPLE HAVE WONDERED WHETHER THE
2300 - TO - 0500 CURFEW IS STILL IN FORCE.  PONCE SAID THE POSSIBILITY
OF LIFTING THE CURFEW AT LEAST ON 24 AND 31 DECEMBER IS BEING
CONSIDERED SO THAT THE SALVADORAN FAMILIES CAN ENJOY THESE
FESTIVITIES.  HE ADDED THAT SUCH A MEASURE, HOWEVER, WILL DEPEND ON
THE FMLN'S STANCE.  FINALLY, PONCE REPORTED THAT THE FMLN
MACHINEGUNNED A BUILDING WITH COFFEE HARVESTERS IN SANTA ANA AND
MAIMED TWO PEOPLE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY REFUSED TO STOP HARVESTING
COFFEE.

DEV-MUC3-1024 (TRW)

   LIMA, 23 DEC 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] PERUVIAN AMBASSADOR IN PANAMA MARIO
CASTRO ARENAS TODAY ASKED THE PERUVIAN PRESIDENT TO SEND MILITARY
PLANES TO PANAMA TO EVACUATE PERUVIAN CITIZENS WHO ARE IN DANGER.

   THE AMBASSADOR TOLD A LOCAL RADIO STATION THAT HE HAD URGED
PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA TO SEND PLANES THAT COULD ALSO BRING
FOOD AND MEDICINE TO THE PANAMANIANS.

   CASTRO ARENAS, WHO HAS BEEN IN LIMA SINCE AUGUST THIS YEAR,
RECALLED BY HIS GOVERNMENT, SAID THAT EARLY THIS MORNING HE RECEIVED A
DESPERATE CALL FROM A GROUP OF PERUVIAN CITIZENS WHO WERE AFRAID THAT
THEY WERE ABOUT TO BE ATTACKED BY A MOB OF PANAMANIANS.

   THE AMBASSADOR EXPLAINED THAT THERE IS "WIDESPREAD LOOTING" IN
PANAMA BECAUSE THE POOREST PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY, AND HE ADDED THAT THE
SITUATION IS ONE OF "CHAOS AND ANARCHY AND NOT OF TRANQUILLITY AS THE
PEOPLE IN LIMA BELIEVE."

   CASTRO ARENAS EXPLAINED THAT THE ATTACKS ON BUILDINGS FROM WHICH
U.S. SOLDIERS ARE BEING RESISTED IS CONSTANTLY THREATENING THE
CIVILIAN POPULATION.  HE SAID THAT HE COULD HEAR "THE BOMBS GOING OFF"
OVER THE TELEPHONE.

   CASTRO ARENAS SAID THAT THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 3,000 PERUVIANS IN
PANAMA.  HE ADDED THAT SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE SOUGHT REFUGE AT THE
PERUVIAN EMBASSY IN PANAMA BUT DID NOT SPECIFY THE EXACT NUMBER.  HE
ALSO SAID THAT "THERE IS NO ONE THERE TO TAKE CARE OF THEM."

   ACCORDING TO THE AMBASSADOR, THE PERUVIAN DIPLOMATS ARE ALL BLOCKED
AT THEIR HOMES; THEIR CARS HAVE BEEN TAKEN AWAY, AND ONE OF THEM HAS
BEEN WOUNDED BY A GUNSHOT.

   CASTRO ARENAS SAID THAT HE IS CONSTANTLY RECEIVING CALLS THAT KEEP
HIM INFORMED OF WHAT IS GOING ON IN PANAMA.  HE SAID THAT THE NATIONS
THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWING SO MUCH CONCERN OVER WHAT IS HAPPENING IN
PANAMA SHOULD START URGENTLY SENDING FOOD AND MEDICINE AND "NOT STOP
AT MERE DECLARATIONS."

DEV-MUC3-1033 (TRW)

   SAN SALVADOR, 28 DEC 89 (LA PRENSA GRAFICA) -- [TEXT] FATHER JOSE MARIA
TOJEIRA S.J. [SOCIETY OF JESUS], THE JESUIT PROVINCIAL SPOKESMAN FOR
CENTRAL AMERICA, HAS RELEASED A NOTE DENYING INEXACT REPORTS ON THE CASE OF
THE MURDERED JESUIT PRIESTS.  HE SAID THAT THEY NOT WERE MARXIST GUERRILLA
SYMPATHIZERS.

   THE NOTE READS AS FOLLOWS:

   23 DECEMBER 1989

   PROV. 264/89

   DIRECTOR DUTRIZ

   DIRECTOR OF LA PRENSA GRAFICA

   SAN SALVADOR

   DEAR MR.DIRECTOR:

   THE NEWSPAPER WHICH YOU DIRECT, ON 21 DECEMBER 1989, PUBLISHED ON
PAGES 6 AND 7 TWO ARTICLES ON THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS THAT WERE
MURDERED ON 16 NOVEMBER.  THESE ARTICLES ARE WRITTEN IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THEY DISTORT THE REALITY OF THE CASE OR THEY INCORRECTLY DESCRIBE
THE ACTIVITY OF THE SOCIETY OF JESUS.

   ON PAGE 6 AN ARTICLE ENTITLED "FRATRICIDAL STRUGGLE," WHICH IS
SIGNED BY MR. LUIS PAZOS, SAYS THAT "THE PRIESTS WERE MARXIST
GUERRILLA SYMPATHIZERS" AND THAT THE UNIVERSITY IN WHICH THEY WORK "IS
KNOWN IN EL SALVADOR AS AN INTELLECTUAL CENTER FOR GUERRILLAS."

   THE ARTICLE SPEAKS OF "THESE PRIESTS' NEOMARXIST-PHILOSOPHICAL
POSITION WHICH IS CONTRARY TO CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE."

   I WISH TO STATE THAT:

   1. THE MURDERED PRIESTS WERE NOT SYMPATHIZERS OF THE MARXIST
GUERRILLAS.  THEY ONLY TRIED TO TALK WITH THE DIFFERENT SECTORS IN
CONFLICT IN EL SALVADOR, SEEKING TO MEDIATE IN AN EFFORT TO FIND PEACE
WITH JUSTICE.

   2. PERHAPS SOME PEOPLE IN EL SALVADOR CONSIDER THE UCA [CENTRAL
AMERICAN UNIVERSITY] AS AN INTELLECTUAL CENTER FOR GUERRILLAS,
BUT THERE ARE ALSO MANY PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT THE UCA COURAGEOUSLY
FOLLOWS THE CHURCH'S SOCIAL DOCTRINE.  THIS STATEMENT, IF MADE WITHOUT
THE RESERVATION THAT IT ONLY REPRESENTS THE VIEWS OF A GROUP OF PEOPLE
AND THE FACT THAT THE ARTICLE FORGETS TO MENTION THE MANY OTHERS DO
NOT BELIEVE, IS IN OUR OPINION A MANIPULATION OF THE TRUTH.

   3. THE POSITION OF THE PRIESTS WAS NOT "NEOMARXIST" IN THE
PHILOSOPHICAL FIELD.  FATHER ELLACURIA CAME FROM THE SCHOOL OF THE
SPANISH PHILOSOPHER ZUBIRI, WHOSE THOUGHTS WERE DEEPLY ROOTED IN
CHRISTIAN PHILOSOPHY.  FATHER AMANDO LOPEZ WROTE HIS DOCTORAL THESIS
ON THE SPANISH PHILOSOPHER AND PRIEST AMOR RUIBAL.  THE "ZUBIRIAN"
INCLINATION OF FATHER ELLACURIA WAS INTERNATIONALLY KNOWN IN MOST
PHILOSOPHICAL SCHOOLS.  THOSE WHO ACCUSE THE MURDERED PRIESTS OF
HAVING NEOMARXIST PHILOSOPHICAL POSITIONS ARE PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGING
THEIR IGNORANCE.

   4. STATEMENTS SUCH AS THESE, WHICH WERE REPEATED IN OTHER MEDIA
BEFORE THE MURDER OF THE PRIESTS, PARTLY PROMOTED THEIR MURDER.  WE
THEREFORE CONSIDER THEIR REPETITION TO BE A VERY SERIOUS MATTER.

   ON PAGE 7, AND IN AN EDITORIAL ARTICLE, THE NEWSPAPER MENTIONS THE
NEED TO AVOID "THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY PRIVATE PSEUDO-INVESTIGATIONS,
WHEREVER THEY MIGHT COME FROM."  ON THIS STATEMENT I WANT TO SIMPLY
ADD THAT IN A CASE LIKE THIS THE INJURED PARTY HAS EVERY RIGHT, BOTH
IN EL SALVADOR AND IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE WORLD, TO CONDUCT ITS OWN
PRIVATE INVESTIGATION.  FURTHERMORE, UNLESS PUBLICLY AND IRREFUTABLY
PROVEN HARMFUL, NO ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO CONDEMN IT "IN ADVANCE" SAYING
THAT IT IS PLAYING DETECTIVES.

   I BEG OF YOU MR. DIRECTOR, BASED ON THE RIGHT TO REPLY AND THE
JUSTICE THAT THE MURDERED JESUITS AND THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN THEM
DESERVE, THAT YOU PUBLISH THIS CLARIFICATIONS IN YOUR NEWSPAPER WITH
THE SAME DESIRE TO REACH YOUR READERS AS THOSE WHO WROTE THE ARTICLES.

   YOURS TRULY.

   FATHER JOSE MARIA TOJEIRA

   SOCIETY OF JESUS PROVINCIAL."

DEV-MUC3-1035 (TRW)

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 2 JAN 90 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[PRESS AND INFORMATION DIRECTORATE OF THE PRESIDENCY] [TEXT] THE PRESS
AND INFORMATION DIRECTORATE OF THE PRESIDENCY ANNOUNCES TO THE
NICARAGUAN PEOPLE AND TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT ACCORDING TO
PRELIMINARY REPORTS, ON 1 JANUARY AT 1930, A GROUP OF
COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY MERCENARIES, FINANCED BY THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT,
AMBUSHED MEMBERS OF A RELIGIOUS GROUP HEADED BY MSGR PABLO SMITH,
BISHOP OF THE BLUEFIELDS APOSTOLIC VICARIATE, IN A PLACE KNOWN AS OJO
DE AGUA, LOCATED BETWEEN ARANCHAMBA AND COPERNA, NORTHERN ATLANTIC
REGION, RESULTING IN THE DEATH OF NUNS MAUREEN CONNALY, AN AMERICAN
CITIZEN, AND TERESA ROSALES MISQUITA.  BISHOP PABLO SMITH AND
FRANCISCA COLOMER MISQUITA WERE SERIOUSLY WOUNDED.  THIS IS PART OF
THE ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE BY THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT, WHICH INVADED
PANAMA AND CONDUCTED A MILITARY INCURSION INTO THE HOME OF THE
NICARAGUAN AMBASSADOR IN THAT COUNTRY.

   THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT CONDEMNS THESE SERIOUS INCIDENTS, WHICH
ENDANGER THE PEACE EFFORTS CONDUCTED BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
PRESIDENTS AND SUPPORTED BY THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE.  NICARAGUAN
PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA SAAVEDRA CALLS ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
AND ON THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FORCES TO CONDEMN THIS
BRUTAL CRIME PERPETRATED AGAINST RELIGIOUS PEOPLE.  THIS ACTION IS
SIMILAR TO THE ASSASSINATION OF THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS PERPETRATED IN
SAN SALVADOR ON 16 NOVEMBER 1989 BY THE SALVADORAN ARMY, WHICH JUST AS
THE COUNTERREVOLUTION AND THE OTHER RIGHTIST NICARAGUAN FORCES,
DEFENDS THE AGGRESSIVE POLICIES OF THE UNITED STATES.

   MANAGUA, 2 JANUARY 1990.

DEV-MUC3-1040 (TRW)

   SAN SALVADOR, 8 JAN 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] COLONEL RENE
EMILIO PONCE, CHIEF OF THE SALVADOAN ARMED FORCES' GENERAL
STAFF, HAS ADMITTED THAT 2 OFFICERS AND 45 SOLDIERS OF AN
ELITE BATTALION ARE "BEING HELD IN VARIOUS GUARRISONS OF
SAN SALVADOR" WHILE INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE KILLING OF THE             
SIX JESUITS CONTINUE.

   ACCORDING TO PONCE, THESE OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS OF THE ATLACATL BATTALION
WERE PLACED AT THE DISPOSITION OF THE CRIMES INVESTIGATIVE COMMISSION, WHICH
IS STUDYING THE CASE OF THE JESUITS WHO WERE SHOT TO DEATH ON 16 NOVEMBER.  

   SPANISH, BRITISH, FRENCH, AND CANADIAN POLICE AGENTS HAVE
PARTICIPATED IN THESE INVESTIGATIONS.

   THESE SALVADORAN SOLDIERS HAD SEARCHED THE JESUITS' RESIDENCE 2
DAYS BEFORE THE KILLING, PONCE TOLD THE MEDIA TODAY WITHOUT GIVING
MUCH DETAIL.

   HOWEVER, DIPLOMATIC SOURCES STATED THAT THE SOLDIERS WILL BE
"CONFINED" TO THEIR RESPECTIVE GARRISONS AND ADDED THAT THEY INCLUDE
"FIVE OFFICERS."

   FRANCISCO ESTRADA, A SALVADORAN PRIEST WHO WAS APPOINTED NEW RECTOR
OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY (UCA), SAID THAT "THE PRESIDENT'S
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES COMMITTED THIS CRIME, IS
AN IMPORTANT STEP VERY SELDOM TAKEN IN THIS COUNTRY."  HOWEVER, THIS
"MATTER IS NOT OVER WITH YET."

   "WHAT WOULD REALLY BE NEW IS FOR HIM TO SAY WHO DID IT, INSTEAD OF
JUST SAYING THAT IT WAS THE ARMED FORCES," THE PRIEST TOLD ACAN-EFE
AND ADDED THAT HE TRUSTS IN THE "GOODWILL AND ETHICS" OF PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI.

   EVERY SOURCE CONSULTED WITH BY ACAN-EFE, WHETHER DIPLOMATIC OR
RELIGIOUS, AGREED TO SAY THAT NOW IT IS IMPORTANT FOR CRISTIANI TO
TAKE ONE STEP FURTHER AND MENTION THE NAMES OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN
THIS MURDER CARRIED OUT AT UCA.

   TWO DOMESTIC SERVANTS (A MOTHER AND A DAUGHTER) WERE KILLED
TOGETHER WITH THE CLERGYMEN, FIVE SPANIARDS, INCLUDING UCA RECTOR
IGNACIO ELLACURIA, AND A SALVADORAN.

   THE U.S.  EMBASSY IN EL SALVADOR ALSO CONGRATULATED CRISTIANI TODAY FOR
HIS EFFORTS TO CLARIFY THE ASSASSINATION, AS U.S.  CONGRESSMEN AND OFFICIALS
OF THE [GEORGE] BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAD ASKED OF HIM.

   IN FACT, DIPLOMATIC SOURCES COMMENTED TO ACAN-EFE THAT BEGINNING ON 22
JANUARY, THE U.S.  CONGRESS IS TO DISCUSS A NEW $90 MILLION PACKAGE OF
ECONOMIC AND MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR THAT MIGHT HINGE ON THE STATUS OF
THE INVESTIGATIONS.

   THE UNITED STATES HAS GIVEN OVER $3 BILLION IN MILITARY AND
ECONOMIC AID TO EL SALVADOR OVER THE PAST DECADE, AND AT PRESENT IT IS
GIVING ABOUT $1.4 MILLION DAILY, ACCORDING TO SALVADORAN POLITICAL
SOURCES.

   UCA RECTOR FRANCISCO ESTRADA SAID THAT CRISTIANI COULD TAKE THIS
STEP BECAUSE "HE IS CONFIDENT THAT HE CAN CONTROL ANY INTERNAL
RESENTMENT WITHIN HIS GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES."

   A SIMILAR OPINION WAS EXPRESSED BY A EUROPEAN DIPLOMAT, WHO TOLD
ACAN-EFE THAT CRISTIANI IS TAKING A GREAT RISK BY ACCUSING MEMBERS OF
THE ARMED FORCES OF THIS CRIME.  HE ADDED: " IF HE HAS DONE THIS, IT
IS BECAUSE HE FEELS VERY SELF-CONFIDENT."

   OBSERVERS COMPARE THE INVESTIGATION BEING CARRIED OUT BY THE
PRESENT RIGHTIST GOVERNMENT WITH ONE CARRIED OUT BY THE GOVERNMENT OF
JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE, A CHRISTIAN DEMOCRAT, INTO THE 1980 MURDER OF
SALVADORAN ARCHBISHOP OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO.

   DUARTE, WHO TURNED OVER POWER TO CRISTIANI ON 1 JUNE 1989, ON SEVERAL
OCCASIONS ATTRIBUTED THE MURDER OF ARCHBISHOP ROMERO TO ROBERTO D'
AUBUISSON, A PRESENT DEPUTY AND LEADER OF THE RULING NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN
ALLIANCE, BUT THE INVESTIGATIONS NEVER LED TO ANY CONCRETE RESULTS.

DEV-MUC3-1041 (TRW)

   MADRID (SPAIN), 8 JAN 90 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] HERE IN MADRID, THE
LEFT-WING LEADER OF THE SALVADORAN OPPOSITION, RUBEN ZAMORA, HAD A MEETING
JUST A FEW MINUTES' AGO WITH FOREIGN MINISTER FRANCISCO FERNANDEZ ORDONEZ,
BEFORE STARTING A EUROPEAN TOUR SEEKING AID TO OVERCOME THE CRISIS FACING THE
CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRY.  GLORIA DEL CAMPO REPORTS FROM THE FOREIGN
MINISTRY, SANTA CRUZ PALACE:

   [DEL CAMPO] RUBEN ZAMORA BELIEVES THAT IF, AS IT HAS BEEN
ANNOUNCED, OFFICIALS OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY ARE TO BE BROUGHT TO TRIAL
FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF SIX JESUITS AND TWO EMPLOYEES OF THE CENTRAL
AMERICAN UNIVERSITY, IT WILL BE THE FIRST TIME THAT THIS HAS BEEN DONE
AND THAT, TO A LARGE EXTENT, THIS IS DUE TO THE PRESSURE OF COUNTRIES
LIKE SPAIN, THE EEC, AND THE REST OF THE WORLD.  BUT, SPEAKING TO RNE,
RUBEN ZAMORA EXPRESSED HIS RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE REAL IDENTITY AND
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PERPETRATORS OF THE MASSACRE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ZAMORA] PRESIDENT CRISTIANI HAS STILL NOT GIVEN
ANY NAMES AND SO WE CAN'T SAY ANYTHING BECAUSE IT'S ALL BASED ON
RUMORS.  THEREFORE, THE FIRST THING TO BE SEEN IS WHO IS INVOLVED AND,
SECONDLY, WHETHER THEY ARE REALLY BROUGHT TO TRIAL AND, THIRDLY,
WHETHER THEY REALLY ARE SENTENCED FOR THE CRIME WHICH THEY HAVE
COMMITTED.  SO, THERE ARE STILL MANY OBSTACLES IN THE WAY BEFORE
GIVING A FINAL OPINION ON THE MATTER.  [END RECORDING]

   [DEL CAMPO] RUBEN ZAMORA HAD A 45-MINUTE MEETING WITH SPANISH
FOREIGN MINISTER FRANCISCO FERNANDEZ ORDONEZ AT THE FOREIGN MINISTRY.
HE EXPRESSED THE NEED FOR AND URGENCY OF A POLITICAL SOLUTION IN EL
SALVADOR, OF AIDING -- THROUGH THE MEDIATION OF THE UN SECRETARY
GENERAL -- NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FARABUNDO MARTI

DEV-MUC3-1042 (TRW)

   PANAMA CITY (PANAMA), 12 JAN 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] SOME 150
PEOPLE THREW STONES AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY IN PANAMA CITY TODAY TO
PROTEST THE PRESENCE AT THE EMBASSY OF 12 REFUGEES CLOSELY LINKED TO
FORMER GENERAL MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA.

   RESIDENTS OF A NEARBY NEIGHBORHOOD GATHERED IN FRONT OF THE EMBASSY
SHOUTING SLOGANS AGAINST THE MILITARY AND CIVILIAN REFUGEES, WHOM THEY
SHOUTED SHOULD BE "SHOT," AND AGAINST THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT FOR
GRANTING THEM ASYLUM.

   THE DEMONSTRATORS, WHO BROKE THE WINDSHIELDS OF SOME VEHICLES
PASSING IN FRONT OF THE EMBASSY, WERE FORCED AWAY FROM THE FRONT OF
THE EMBASSY BY MEMBERS OF THE PANAMANIAN PUBLIC FORCE AND U.S.
SOLDIERS.

   THE PANAMANIANS WHO SOUGHT SHELTER AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY ARE
MAJOR EDGARDO LOPEZ GRIMALDO, SPOKESMEN OF THE FORMER DEFENSE FORCES;
MAJOR GONZALO GONZALEZ, CHIEF OF THE ELITE "MACHO DE MONTE" COMPANY;
NORIEGA'S FORMER SECRETARY, MARCELA TASON; CAPTAIN NARCISA CASTILLERO;
MAJOR HERACLIDES SUCRE; AND SEVEN RELATIVES OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED
PEOPLE.

      SUCRE WAS CHARGED TODAY BY PANAMANIAN ATTORNEY GENERAL ROGELIO
CRUZ WITH BEING INVOLVED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF MAJOR MOISES GIROLDI,
WHO PROMOTED A FOILED COUP AGAINST NORIEGA ON 3 OCTOBER 1989.

   PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA TODAY EXPRESSED HIS WILLINGNESS TO
PROTECT "AS LONG AS NECESSARY" THE FORMER NORIEGA AIDES WHO SOUGHT
SHELTER AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY IN PANAMA.

   PERU ANNOUNCED ON 9 JANUARY THAT IT HAS GRANTED ASYLUM TO FIVE
PANAMANIAN MILITARY AND SEVEN OF THEIR RELATIVES.  THE PANAMANIAN
GOVERNMENT SAID ON 12 JANUARY THAT IT WILL NOT GRANT SAFE-CONDUCT FOR
THESE PEOPLE, WHOM IT CONSIDERS "COMMON CRIMINALS," TO LEAVE THE
COUNTRY.

   THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ON 11 JANUARY SAID THE PANAMANIAN PUBLIC FORCE
IS IN CHARGE OF GUARDING THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY AND POINTED OUT THAT THE
SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS POSED BY THE PRESENCE OF THE REFUGEES SHOULD BE
HANDLED BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF PANAMA AND PERU.

   THE PERUVIAN PRESIDENT SAID TODAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF PANAMANIAN
PRESIDENT GUILLERMO ENDARA IS "UNLAWFUL."  HE ADDED THAT PANAMA IS
BEING RULED BY "THE STATE DEPARTMENT, THE PENTAGON, THE SOUTHERN
COMMAND, AND THE U.S.  TROOPS."

DEV-MUC3-1043 (TRW)

   SAN SALVADOR, 10 JAN 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] A MILITARY SOURCE,
QUOTING INTELLIGENCE SOURCES, SAID TODAY THAT THE SALVADORAN
GUERRILLAS HAVE ABANDONED THEIR STRICTLY MILITARY GOALS TO INSTEAD
DIRECT THEIR ACTIONS AGAINST ECONOMIC TARGETS, WITHIN THEIR USUAL
PATTERN OF WEARING DOWN THE ECONOMY.

   THE SOURCE ATTRIBUTED THE CHANGE IN TACTICS TO THE "FAILURE" OF THE
OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
(FMLN) ON 11 NOVEMBER, IN WHICH SIX GUERRILLA COMMANDERS AND ALL
GUERRILLA TROOPS TOOK PART.

   ACCORDING TO THE FMLN, THE OFFENSIVE'S GOAL WAS TO NEGOTIATE WITH
THE GOVERNMENT ON A "ONE-TO-ONE" BASIS.  IN THE OPINION OF THE ARMY,
HOWEVER, THE FMLN WAS TRYING TO CAUSE AN INSURRECTION AMONG THE PEOPLE
TO GRAB POWER.

   THE SOURCE, WHO REQUESTED ANONYMITY, TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT FOLLOWING
THE OFFENSIVE, THE FMLN DECIDED TO "READAPT" THEIR MILITARY CADRES TO
THE TRADITIONAL "PROLONGED PEOPLE'S WAR."

   MILITARY INTELLIGENCE BELIEVES THAT WITH THIS CHANGE IN TACTICS,
THE GUERRILLAS ARE TRYING TO "MAINTAIN THEIR MILITARY PRESENCE AND
THUS RAISE THE FIGHTERS MORALE FOLLOWING THE DISBANDING OF IMPORTANT
MILITARY CADRES."

   FOLLOWING THE SUSPENSION OF THE UNILATERAL TRUCE DECREED BY THE
FMLN BETWEEN 23 DECEMBER AND 2 JANUARY, THE GUERRILLAS RESTARTED THEIR
ACTIONS AGAINST THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMY BY BLOWING-UP THE COUNTRY'S
POWER GRID AND SHOPS IN SAN SALVADOR.

   ECONOMIC LOSSES LAST YEAR DUE TO GUERRILLA SABOTAGE TO THE
TRANSPORT, POWER AND TELEPHONE SYSTEMS, AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURES
SURPASSED $100 MILLION, ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL SOURCES.

   THE SOURCE SAID THAT THE MILITARY RESTRUCTURE ENCOMPASSED THE SIX
ORGANIZATIONS THAT COMPRISE THE FMLN: THE REVOLUTIONARY PARTY OF
CENTRAL AMERICAN WORKERS (PRTC), THE NATIONAL RESISTANCE (RN), THE
SALVADORAN COMMUNIST PARTY (PCS), THE POPULAR LIBERATION FORCES (FPL),
THE ARMED FORCES OF LIBERATION (FAL), AND THE PEOPLE'S REVOLUTIONARY
ARMY (ERP).

   ACCORDING TO MILITARY INTELLIGENCE, THE PRTC, RN, AND THE PCS NOW
OPERATE IN SAN SALVADOR AND OTHER IMPORTANT CITIES OF THE COUNTRY,
WHILE THE FPL OPERATES IN THE CENTRAL REGION, THE ERP IN THE
NORTHEAST, AND THE FAL IN THE SOUTHEAST.

DEV-MUC3-1044 (TRW)

   PANAMA CITY (PANAMA), 13 JAN 90 (LA PRENSA) -- [ARTICLE] [MANOLO
ALVAREZ CEDENO] [TEXT] SOME 150 PERSONS PICKETED AND THREW STONES AT
THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY ON 12 JANUARY.  THE DEMONSTRATORS DEMANDED THAT
FORMER PANAMA DEFENSE FORCES [FDP] MAJOR EDGARDO LOPEZ GRIMALDO, AND
OTHERS CLOSELY LINKED TO THE FORMER MILITARY REGIME WHO SOUGHT REFUGE
AT THE EMBASSY, BE ASKED TO LEAVE THE MISSION.

   THE DEMONSTRATORS SHOUTED SLOGANS AGAINST NORIEGA AND THREW SOME
STONES.  THEY BROKE THE REAR WINDSHIELDS OF TWO DIPLOMATIC VEHICLES
PARKED IN FRONT OF THE EMBASSY: A WHITE MITSUBISHI, LICENSE PLATES
CD-325, AND A RED MITSUBISHI, LICENSE PLATES CD-142.

   "GRIMALDO...COWARD KILLER, COME OUT AND SHOW YOUR FACE," THE CROWD
SHOUTED WHILE THE U.S. SOLDIERS GUARDING THE MISSION GENTLY MOVED THEM
IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SIDEWALK ACROSS THE STREET.  SOME EIGHT
MEMBERS OF THE NEW PANAMANIAN PUBLIC FORCE, ALSO GUARDING THE EMBASSY,
DID NOT INTERVENE.

   DESPITE THE SHOUTS DEMANDING "JUSTICE AND PRISON" FOR NORIEGA'S
FOLLOWERS, NO ONE CAME OUT OF THE EMBASSY LOCATED ON "F" STREET, EL
CANGREJO, A MIDDLE-CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD IN PANAMA CITY.

   MAJOR GONZALO GONZALEZ, COMMANDER OF THE ELITE "MACHO DE MONTE"
COMPANY THAT FOILED THE 3 OCTOBER COUP AGAINST NORIEGA; HERACLIDES
SUCRE, WHO HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS ONE OF THE TWO OFFICERS WHO "SHOT"
MOISES GIROLDI; AND MARCELA TASON, NORIEGA'S PERSONAL SECRETARY ARE
ALSO AT THE EMBASSY WITH LOPEZ GRIMALDO, WHO WAS THE SPOKESMAN FOR THE
DISMANTLED FDP.

   APPROXIMATELY 40 U.S. SOLDIERS, SUPPORTED BY AN ARMORED PERSONNEL
CARRIER AND THREE "HUMMER" ARMORED VEHICLES, ARE GUARDING THE PERUVIAN
EMBASSY.

   AT THE TIME OF THE DEMOSTRATIONS, RESIDENTS IN NEARBY BUILDINGS
WAVED WHITE HANDERCHIEFS AND BANGED POTS AND PANS, AND EMPTY CANS.  A
SIMILAR SITUATION WAS OCCURRING ON THE STREET.

   ONE OF THE DEMONSTRATORS TOLD LA PRENSA: "WE WILL STAY HERE UNTIL
THEY COME OUT BECAUSE THEY MUST PAY FOR THEIR CRIMES; WE WILL COME
BACK HERE EVERY AFTERNOON."

   THE U.S. SOLDIERS CORDONED OFF THE AREA WITH CONCERTINA WIRE WHILE
A GROUP OF PEOPLE "BOOED" THEM FOR DOING THIS.

   SAN JOSE (COSTA RICA), 15 JAN 90 (DPA) -- [TEXT] COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT
OSCAR ARIAS TODAY URGED GUATEMALA PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO TO FOLLOW THE
EXAMPLE OF SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND ORDER AN "EXHAUSTIVE
INVESTIGATION INTO THE MURDER OF SALVADORAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LEADER HECTOR
OQUELI COLINDRES IN GUATEMALA 2 DAYS AGO.

   ARIAS SAID: "I HOPE PRESIDENT CEREZO WILL DUPLICATE THE ACTIONS
TAKEN BY HIS COUNTERPART ALFREDO CRISTIANI IN THE CASE OF THE JESUITS
WHO WERE SAVAGELY KILLED 2 MONTHS AGO IN EL SALVADOR."

   THE COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT HARSHLY CRITICIZED "HECTOR OQUELI'S
MURDERERS.  THIS IS A HORRIBLE CRIME," HE SAID.

   THE COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT IS VERY MOVED BY THE MURDER OF OQUELI,
BECAUSE THEY STUDIED TOGETHER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ESSEX, GREAT
BRITAIN, 22 YEARS AGO, WHEN ARIAS OBTAINED HIS DOCTORATE.

   "HE WAS A GREAT FRIEND AND COMRADE," ARIAS SAID, RECALLING THE
DEEDS OF THE MURDERED SALVADORAN POLITICIAN, WHO VISITED COSTA RICA
SEVERAL TIMES TO PARTICIPATE IN LECTURES, SEMINARS, AND DISCUSSIONS.

DEV-MUC3-1049 (TRW)

   BOGOTA, 17 JAN 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAS
OFFERED FULL GUARANTEES OF DUE PROCESS [GARANTIAS PROCESALES] TO DRUG
TRAFFICKERS WHO LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND STOP THEIR TERRORIST
ACTIVITIES AND SMUGGLING OF DRUGS TO OTHER COUNTRIES, BUT SAID IT WILL
NOT ENTER INTO DEALS WITH THEM THAT MAY VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION OR
THE LAWS.

   THE STATEMENT, WHICH WAS THE FIRST TO BE MADE BY AN OFFICIAL
SOURCE, WAS MADE BY GOVERNMENT MINISTER CARLOS LEMOS TO A TELEVISION
NEWSCAST.

   COMMENTING ON THE COMMUNIQUE IN WHICH THE EXTRADITABLES OFFER TO
END THEIR ILLEGAL TRADE, RELEASE THE HOSTAGES THEY ARE HOLDING, AND
STOP THEIR ATTACKS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND SOCIETY
"RESPECT FOR OUR RIGHTS AND RETURN TO OUR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES,"
LEMOS SAID: "THE COLOMBIAN CONSTITUTION AND LAWS GUARANTEE A DUE
PROCESS AND RIGHT TO DEFENSE, BUT OF COURSE THEY ALSO DEMAND THAT
THOSE WHO BREAK THE LAWS SUBMIT TO THEM SO THAT, THROUGH THE JUDGES
AND INDEPENDENT OF ANY INTERVENTION BY THE GOVERNMENT, THE DEGREE OF
RESPONSIBILITY OF EACH ONE OF THEM AND WHETHER THERE ARE GROUNDS FOR
PUNISHMENT CAN BE DETERMINED."

   HE ADDED: "THESE PERSONS, THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS, WILL ENJOY FULL
LEGAL GUARANTEES, BUT THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT THERE WILL BE
COMPROMISES OF ANY KIND, BECAUSE THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE GOVERNMENT
CANNOT VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION."

   EXPLAINING THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS WON THIS WAR ON THE BASIS OF
MAKING NO CONCESSIONS, LEMOS SAID: "I DO NOT SEE ANY REASON TO CHANGE
OUR POLICY OF NOT NEGOTIATING WHEN OUR OWN ENEMIES HAVE SAID THAT THIS
POLICY HAS TRIUMPHED."

   IN THEIR COMMUNIQUE, WHICH WAS DELIVERED THROUGH TWO WOMEN WHO WERE
KIDNAPPED AND RELEASED IN MEDELLIN, SEAT OF THE CARTEL BY THE SAME
NAME, THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS RECOGNIZED THE STATE'S VICTORY OVER THE
CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION AND AT THE SAME TIME OFFERED TO ABIDE BY THE
LAWS.

DEV-MUC3-1059 (TRW)

   QUITO, 18 JAN 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] A CALL FOR FREE ELECTIONS IN
PANAMA, SUPPORT FOR PUERTO RICAN INDEPENDENCE, AND THE CONDEMNATION OF
HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN GUATEMALA AND EL SALVADOR WERE SOME OF THE
CONCLUSIONS REACHED AT THE END OF THE MEETING OF THE SOCIALIST
INTERNATIONAL [IS] COMMISSION FOR LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN THIS
AFTERNOON IN QUITO.  THE IS FOCUSED ON THE SITUATION IN PANAMA,
REITERATING ITS STRONG CONDEMNATION OF THE U.S. INVASION AND DEMANDING
"THE IMMEDIATE AND UNCONDITIONAL WITHDRAWAL" OF THOSE TROOPS.  IT ALSO
DEMANDED THAT "FREE AND DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS BE HELD WITHOUT FOREIGN
MEDDLING."

   THE IS CONDEMNED THE SERIOUS HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND DEATHS
DURING THE U.S. INVASION AND SAID IT WAS NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH AN
INVESTIGATIVE COMMISSION WITH THE COOPERATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL RED
CROSS.  IN ADDITION, IT ASKED THAT THE TORRIJOS - CARTER TREATIES BE
RESPECTED.  THE GROUP ALSO DEMANDED ABSOLUTE RESPECT FOR DIPLOMATIC
IMMUNITY AND SANCTITY, AND REJECTED THE ROLE OF "POLICEMAN TO PROTECT
DEMOCRACY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WANTS TO ASSIGN ITSELF."  IT NOTED THE
URGENCY IN JOINING EFFORTS TO FIND PATHS THAT WILL LEAD TO THE
REESTABLISHMENT OF SOVEREIGNTY AND DEMOCRACY IN PANAMA.

   MOREOVER, THE IS VOICED SUPPORT FOR THE EFFORTS THE PUERTO RICAN
INDEPENDENTIST PARTY IS MAKING TO GET THE U.S. CONGRESS TO ALLOW A
REFERENDUM IN PUERTO RICO.  THE REFERENDUM WILL LET PUERTO RICANS
DECIDE THEIR POLITICAL FUTURE, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF INDEPENDENCE
SOME AREA COUNTRIES ARE DEMANDING.

   THE IS COMMITTEE ALSO NOTED ITS CONCERN OVER THE CLIMATE OF
INSECURITY AND REPEATED HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS THE PROPERO AVRIL
GOVERNMENT IS FOSTERING IN HAITI.  AFTER INDICATING THAT THIS
SITUATION "IMPERILS" THE ELECTIONS SET FOR THIS YEAR, THE IS CALLED ON
THE GOVERNMENT TO ADOPT THE MEASURES THAT ENSURE HUMAN RIGHTS ARE
RESPECTED.

   IN ADDITION, THE COMMITTEE CONDEMNED THE RECENT MURDER IN GUATEMALA
OF POLITICAL LEADERS HECTOR OQUELI COLINDRES AND GILDA AMPARO FLORES
AREVALO.  IT ALSO ANNOUNCED A COMMISSION WILL BE SENT TO THE
GOVERNMENTS OF EL SALVADOR AND GUATEMALA TO FIND THE PERSONS
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MURDERS.

   ON THE TOPIC OF DRUG TRAFFICKING, THE IS COMMISSION DEMANDS THAT
THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ADOPT THE MEASURES NEEDED
TO LOWER INTERNAL DISTRIBUTION AND CONSUMPTION OF DRUGS AND TO FIGHT
MONEY LAUNDERING.

   IN CONCLUSION, THE COMMISSION DISCUSSED A PRELIMINARY REPORT BY AN
IS MISSION THAT VISITED NICARAGUA TO OBSERVE THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN.
THE REPORT NOTES THAT, "CONSIDERING THE COUNTRY'S SITUATION, THE
MISSION FEELS THE ELECTORAL PROCESS HAS BEEN SATISFACTORY SO FAR."

   ENRIQUE SILVA CIMMA, IS VICE PRESIDENT AND FUTURE CHILEAN FOREIGN
MINISTER, CHAIRED THE 2-DAY MEETING THAT GATHERED 64 POLITICAL LEADERS
FROM 10 COUNTRIES OF THE REGION AND GUESTS FROM THE UNITED STATES,
FRG, ISRAEL, THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIALIST OF WOMEN, AND THE
INTER-AMERICAN REGIONAL ORGANIZATION OF WORKERS.

   SILVA CIMMA SAID THAT THIS AND OTHER MEETINGS DO NOT AIM AT SETTING
GUIDELINES THE PARTIES ARE OBLIGATED TO FOLLOW.  INSTEAD, THE MEETINGS
ALLOW PARTIES TO EXCHANGE VIEWS REGARDING THE NEED TO DEAL WITH THE
FUNDAMENTAL VIEWS OF THIS IDEOLOGICAL CONCEPT WITHIN THE BASIC IDEAL
OF DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM.

DEV-MUC3-1060 (TRW)

   SAN SALVADOR, 19 JAN 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [ARTICLE] [MARISOL MARIN] [TEXT]
SALVADORAN COLONEL GUILLERMO BENAVIDES GAVE THE ORDER TO ASSASSINATE SIX
JESUIT PRIESTS WITH A PEREMPTORY SENTENCE: "EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE; IT IS
EITHER US OR THEM.  THESE HAVE BEEN THE INTELLECTUALS WHO HAVE BEEN GUIDING
THE GUERRILLA GROUPS FOR A LONG TIME."

   THIS IS STATED IN A RESOLUTION ISSUED THIS MORNING BY JUDGE RICARDO
ZAMORA WHO ORDERED A PROVISIONAL ARREST WHILE WAITING FOR THE TRIAL OF
THE EIGHT MILITARY OFFICERS IMPLICATED IN THE CRIME AND THE ARREST OF
A THIRD ONE WHO HAS BEEN AT LARGE SINCE DECEMBER.

   TWO LIEUTENANTS AND A SECOND LIEUTENANT HAVE ACCUSED BENAVIDES IN
THEIR DEPOSITIONS AS THE PERSON WHO "GAVE THE ORDER" ON THE EVENING 15
NOVEMBER AT THE MILITARY SCHOOL HE DIRECTED AND WHICH WAS IN CHARGE OF
CONTROLLING THE SECTOR WHERE THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY (UCA) IS
LOCATED.

   "WE WILL START WITH THE LEADERS.  THE UNIVERSITY IS IN OUR SECTOR
AND ELLACURIA IS THERE.  HE MUST BE ELIMINATED AND I WANT NO
WITNESSES," BENAVIDES SAID TO LIEUTENANT YUSSAY RENE MENDOZA
VALLECILLOS, ACCORDING TO THE LATTER'S TESTIMONY.

   A FEW HOURS LATER, EARLY IN THE MORNING OF 16 NOVEMBER, JESUIT
PRIESTS IGNACIO ELLACURIA, RECTOR OF THE UCA; IGNACIO MARTIN BARO,
JUAN RAMON MORENO, JOAQUIN LOPEZ Y LOPEZ, SEGUNDO MONTES (SPANIARDS),
AND AMANDO LOPEZ (SALVADORAN), AS WELL AS THEIR COOK, ELBA JULIA
RAMOS, AND HER DAUGHTER, CELINA MARICET RAMOS, WERE ASSASSINATED.

   IT ALL HAPPENED DURING THE CURFEW AND 5 DAYS AFTER THE FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) GUERRILLA GROUPS HAD LAUNCHED
THEIR LARGEST OFFENSIVE.

   BENAVIDES GAVE THE ORDER TO LIEUTENANT MENDOZA, LIEUTENANT
ESPINOZA, AND SECOND LIEUTENANT GUEVARA CERRITOS, OFFICERS OF THE
ATLACATL BATTALION, AN ELITE UNIT TRAINED BY THE UNITED STATES, WHICH
HAD BEEN SENT TO THE MILITARY SCHOOL.

   THE SOLDIERS WERE TOLD THAT IT WAS NECESSARY "TO ELIMINATE THE
GUERRILLA GROUPS' INTELLECTUAL LEADERS AND THAT THEY WERE AT THE UCA,"
ACCORDING TO CORPORAL ANGEL PEREZ VASQUEZ' DEPOSITION.

   THEY WERE ALSO TOLD THAT "THERE WAS INFORMATION THAT SOME INJURED
TERRORIST CRIMINALS WOULD BE TAKEN TO THE UCA" AND THEY WERE
INSISTENTLY TOLD THAT "ALL THE PEOPLE THERE WERE TERRORISTS."

   ACCORDING TO SECOND SERGEANT ANTONIO RAMIRO AVALOS VARGAS' VERSION,
THE MISSION MUST BE SECRETLY CARRIED OUT BECAUSE THEY WOULD FIND
SUBVERSIVE MATERIAL AND OTHER KINDS OF MATERIAL THAT COULD BE USED,
SUCH AS MEDICINE, BOOTS, AND CLOTHES.

   ACCORDING TO THE MILITARY OFFICERS' DEPOSITIONS GATHERED IN THE
JUDGE'S RESOLUTION, A FLARE WOULD BE FIRED WHEN THEY WERE ABOUT TO
WITHDRAW, TO INDICATE THERE HAD BEEN A CLASH.

   SECOND SERGEANT ANTONIO RAMIRO AVALOS VARGAS SAYS THAT FIVE OF THE
SIX JESUITS WERE TAKEN OUT TO THE GARDEN AND ORDERED TO LIE FACE DOWN,
THEN LIEUTENANT ESPINOZA ORDERED HIM AND PRIVATE MARIANO AMAYA
GRIMALDI TO PROCEED.

   THE THREE OFFICERS ADMITTED THAT THEY KNEW ABOUT THIS, BUT NOT
ABOUT THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE CRIME.  THE FOUR SOLDIERS ADMITTED
THEIR ROLE AS EXECUTIONERS, OUT OF LOYALTY TO THEIR SUPERIORS AND
BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID THEY WOULD BE CONSIDERED TRAITORS.

   THE JUDGE SAID THERE ARE "ENOUGH ELEMENTS" TO ESTABLISH THE
PARTICIPATION OF COLONEL GUILLERMO BENAVIDES IN THESE ACTIONS,
INCLUDING, FIRST OF ALL, THE DEPOSITION SIGNED BY COLONEL RENE EMILIO
PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF.

   PONCE SAID HE ORDERED THE CREATION OF A SECURITY COMMANDO, WITH
HEADQUARTERS IN THE MILITARY SCHOOL AND UNDER COLONEL GUILLERMO
ALFREDO BENAVIDES' COMMAND, TO DEFEND THE MILITARY INSTALLATIONS
LOCATED IN THE ZONE WHICH MIGHT BECOME THE TARGETS OF "A TERRORIST
AGGRESSION."  THE UCA IS ALSO LOCATED IN THE ZONE.

   THE JUDICIAL RESOLUTION INCLUDES THE DEPOSITIONS GIVEN BY ALL THE
PRISONERS TO THE POLICE, EXCEPT COL BENAVIDES, WHO MET WITH JUDGE
RICARDO ZAMORA FOR OVER 2 HOURS.

   THE INVESTIGATION WAS CARRIED OUT BY A CRIME INVESTIGATION
COMMISSION WHICH LATER SENT THE EVIDENCE AND FINDINGS TO AN ARMY HONOR
COMMISSION THAT WILL COOPERATE IN DETERMING WHO IS RESPONSIBLE.

DEV-MUC3-1063 (TRW)

   MOSCOW (USSR), 23 JAN 90 (TASS INTERNATIONAL SERVICE) -- [TEXT] FROM THE
SOVIET POINT OF VIEW, THE QUESTION OF DELIVERIES OF WEAPONS TO THE
GOVERNMENT OF EL SALVADOR TAKES ON, IN PRESENT CONDITIONS, A PARTICULAR
SIGNIFICANCE.  THIS WAS ANNOUNCED TODAY AT A BRIEFING BY GENNADIY GERASIMOV,
HEAD OF THE USSR MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS INFORMATION DIRECTORATE, WHO
REPORTED THE DEBATES OPENING IN THE U.S. CONGRESS ON GIVING U.S.  MILITARY
AID TO THAT COUNTRY.

   IN RECENT TIMES, THE USSR FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN NOTED, CERTAIN
ADVANCES HAVE BEEN OUTLINED IN THE MATTER OF RENEWING DIALOGUE BETWEEN
THE OPPOSING SIDES IN EL SALVADOR.  HOWEVER, THE OPPONENTS OF NATIONAL
RECONCILIATION IN THAT COUNTRY ARE TRYING TO PREVENT A CONSTRUCTIVE
DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE REBELS AND ARE COUNTING ON THE
CONTINUATION OF BLOODSHED.  THE EL SALVADOR PRESIDENT ALFONSO CRISTIAN
CONFIRMED THE INVOLVEMENT OF TROOPS IN THE MURDER OF PRIESTS.  A NEW
VICTIM OF THE TERROR IS HECTOR OQUELI, EXECUTIVE SECRETARY OF THE
SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE ON THE PROBLEMS OF THE COUNTRIES OF
LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN BASIN AND ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE
NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT PARTY, SAID GENNADIY GERASIMOV.

   THE LEADERSHIP OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT,
THE SOVIET DIPLOMAT NOTED, HAS STATED ITS DECISION TO STOP CONDUCTING
FURTHER COMBAT OPERATIONS IF THE UNITED STATES HALTS ITS MILITARY AID
TO THE RULING REGIME.

   IN THESE CONDITIONS, GERASIMOV STRESSED, THE CONTINUATION OF ARMS
SUPPLIES TO THE SALVADORAN ARMY IN FACT PLAYS INTO THE HANDS OF THOSE
WHO BLATANTLY VIOLATE HUMAN RIGHTS AND DOES NOT PROMOTE THE
STRENGTHENING OF THE POSITIONS OF THOSE WHO CHAMPION DIALOGUE AND
NATIONAL RECONCILIATION IN EL SALVADOR.  "ALL OF THAT MAY BECOME A
SERIOUS OBSTACLE IN THE WAY TOWARD A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT IN THAT
COUNTRY AND CENTRAL AMERICA IN GENERAL", HE SAID.

DEV-MUC3-1068 (TRW)

   BOGOTA, 25 JAN 90 (DPA) -- [TEXT] COLOMBIAN AND VENEZUELAN
AUTHORITIES ARE FACED WITH A SERIOUS ECOLOGICAL EMERGENCY TONIGHT
FOLLOWING THE EXPLOSION OF A POWERFUL BOMB PLACED BY GUERRILLAS AT THE
MAIN OIL PIPELINE IN COLOMBIA, CAUSING MORE THAN 15,000 BARRELS OF OIL
TO SPILL AND REACH THE CATATUMBO RIVER ALONG THE BORDER BETWEEN THE
TWO COUNTRIES.

   REPORTS IN BOGOTA POINT OUT THAT THE OIL SPILL, WHICH IS
APPROXIMATELY 3 KM LONG, IS SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD THE CATATUMBO RIVER,
THREATENING TO REACH VENEZUELA'S MARACAIBO LAKE WITHIN HOURS.

   THE DYNAMITE ATTACK WAS PERPETRATED, ACCORDING TO COLOMBIAN
AUTHORITIES, BY THE ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION (ELN), WHICH IS
CONSIDERED THE MOST RADICAL REBEL GROUP OF THE MANY OPERATING IN THE
COUNTRY.

   ACCORDING TO REPORTS, MEMBERS OF THAT INSURGENT ORGANIZATION
COMPLETELY BLEW UP A STRETCH OF THE CANO LIMON-COVENAS OIL PIPELINE,
IN AN AREA CLOSE TO TEORAMA IN NORTE DE SANTANDER DEPARTMENT.

   SINCE LAST YEAR THE ELN, WHICH IS HEADED BY SEVERAL FORMER SPANISH
PRIESTS, HAS PERPETRATED OVER 30 ATTACKS AGAINST COLOMBIAN OIL
INSTALLATIONS TO PROTEST THE JOINT EXPLOITATION OF CRUDE BY THE
GOVERNMENT AND MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES.

DEV-MUC3-1073 (TRW)

   SAN SALVADOR, 29 JAN 90 (CANAL DOCE TELEVISION) -- [TEXT] COLONEL
MAURICIO ERNESTO VARGAS TODAY HAS SAID THERE IS NO NEED OR REASON FOR THE
UNITED STATES TO SUSPEND AID TO THE COUNTRY.  HOWEVER, SHOULD WE GET TO THAT
POINT, THE ARMED FORCES ARE READY TO CONTINUE DEFENDING THE DEMOCRATIC
PROCESS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ALFREDO VILLARREAL, CORRESPONDENT] COL VARGAS
BELIEVES THE U.S. AID IS NOT ONLY A MATTER OF MILITARY ASSISTANCE
PROVIDED TO THE SALVADORAN ARMY, BUT ALSO A MATTER OF DEFENDING THE
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN THE COUNTRY.  THE MILITARY OFFICER SAID IT IS
NOT POSSIBLE THAT A MINORITY, AS HE TERMED THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] WILL AFFECT, WITH ITS
DISINFORMATION METHODS AIMED AT COUNTRIES ABROAD, U.S. MILITARY AID
BEING CUT OFF OR DECREASED.  HOWEVER, IN ANY CASE, COL VARGAS SAID
THAT IF THE AID IS SUSPENDED, THIS WOULD COMPLICATE THE ARMED FORCES
PLANS CONCERNING THE COUNTERINSURGENCY STRUGGLE.

   [COL VARGAS] I CERTAINLY DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE, HAVING A
DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY, HAVE SO LITTLE CAPACITY TO DEFEND THE TRUTH.  IT
CAN TAKE 100 DAYS TO SPREAD A LIE, BUT YOU CAN TELL THE TRUTH IN 1
DAY.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IN THIS CONTEXT....[CHANGES THOUGHT] I
BELIEVE WE ARE OVERESTIMATING THE LEFT-WING ACTIONS.  WE VIEW THEM AS
BEING SMART, AND WE SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLS.  ANY CUT OR SUSPENSION IN
THE AID WILL CAUSE PROBLEMS BECAUSE IT WILL CREATE FURTHER NEEDS
WHENEVER WE NEED TO FULFILL A MISSION.  THEREFORE, MISSIONS WILL BE A
BIT MORE COMPLICATED, BUT WE WILL FULFILL THEM.  IF MARXISTS --
THROUGH THEIR CONCEPT OF DISINFORMATION -- BELIEVE THEY CAN ATTEMPT TO
HARM THE UNITED STATES-EL SALVADOR ALLIANCE THROUGH THIS PROCESS, AND
THAT THIS WILL LEAD THEM TO POWER, THEY ARE COMPLETELY WRONG.  THEY
WILL FIND AN ARMED FORCES WHICH WILL ALWAYS BE FIRMLY DETERMINED TO
DEFEND THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.

   [CORRESPONDENT VILLARREAL] COL VARGAS, IN CHARGE OF THE 3D MILITARY
ZONE IN SAN MIGUEL, SAID HE AGREES WITH THE DECISION TO PROSECUTE THE
EIGHT MILITARY MEN, INCLUDING ONE COLONEL AND TWO LIEUTENANTS, CHARGED
WITH KILLING SIX JESUIT PRIESTS.  COL VARGAS SAID THOSE WHO HAVE
BROKEN THE LAW MUST PAY FOR IT, NO MATTER WHO THEY ARE.

   [COL VARGAS] THE ARMY WILL FEEL PAIN IN THE EVENT ANY OF ITS
MEMBERS ARE INVOLVED IN ACTIONS WHICH VIOLATE THE PRINCIPLES THAT RULE
THE ARMED FORCES.  THIS IS VERY PAINFUL.  HOWEVER, IF WE ARE BUILDING
A DEMOCRACY, THERE ARE FACTS THAT MUST BE JUDGED ACCORDING TO THE
NORMS PREVAILING IN A DEMOCRACY.  DEMOCRACY MUST PREVAIL OVER PEOPLE.
DEMOCRACY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN INDIVIDUALS AND THAN INSTITUTIONS IN
INDIVIDUAL TERMS, AND MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE INDIVIDUAL INTEREST OF
PEOPLE OR GROUPS, WHICH CANNOT PREVAIL OVER THE NATIONAL INTEREST.

   [CORRESPONDENT VILLARREAL] IN THE MILITARY ASPECT, COL VARGAS SAID
THAT AS OF 1990, IN HIS AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY, THEY ARE IMPLEMENTING
THE PLANS DRAFTED BY THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF KNOWN AS "VICTORY AND
HAMMER" WHICH HAS OFFERED, AS PRELIMINARY RESULTS, 53 CLASHES, 37
GUERRILLAS AND 12 SOLDIERS KILLED, AND WEAPONS SEIZURES.  THE TWO
OPERATIONS, HE ADDED, HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL.  [END RECORDING]

DEV-MUC3-1078 (UNISYS)

   SAN SALVADOR, 21 JAN 90 (EL DIARIO DE HOY) -- [TEXT] THE NATIONAL POLICE
ANNOUNCED ON 20 JANUARY THAT IT HAS ABUNDANT EVIDENCE OF THE GUILT OF U.S.
CITIZEN JENNIFER JEAN CASOLO, WHO WAS ARRESTED ON 24 NOVEMBER IN HER HOME IN
THE MIRALVALLE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THIS CAPITAL, WHERE A LARGE NUMBER OF WEAPONS
AND A GREAT QUANTITY OF DOCUMENTS BELONGING TO THE FMLN-FDR [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT - REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATIC FRONT] WERE FOUND
BURIED IN THE YARD.

   CASOLO WAS ARRAIGNED 8 DAYS [AS PUBLISHED] AFTER HER ARREST, BUT
WAS RELEASED BY THE JUDGE "FOR LACK OF EVIDENCE," ACCORDING TO THE
JUDICIAL RECORDS.

   ALTHOUGH IN SALVADORAN JUDICIAL CIRCLES IT IS NOT CLEAR WHY CASOLO
WAS RELEASED, IT IS BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE POLITICAL FACTORS
INVOLVED.

   AT PRESENT, CASOLO HEADS GROUPS THAT HAVE LAUNCHED A VIRULENT
CAMPAIGN AGAINST EL SALVADOR IN THE UNITED STATES, CLAIMING ALLEGED
"RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION."

   CASOLO WAS CAPTURED AFTER THE TERRORIST FAUSTO GALLARDO VALDEZ GAVE
HER NAME TO THE POLICE, TELLING THEM WHERE TO FIND THE WEAPONS THAT HE
AND HIS ACCOMPLICES USED FOR TERRORIST ACTS.  THE PRISONER SAID THAT
THE WEAPONS WERE PROVIDED BY CASOLO AT HER HOME IN THE MIRALVALLE
NEIGHBORHOOD, WHICH SERVED AS A CLANDESTINE ARSENAL.

   IN VIEW OF THIS CONFESSION, THE POLICE REQUESTED THE PARTICIPATION
OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE U.S. EMBASSY, WHO WERE PRESENT IN THE COURSE
OF THE PROCEEDINGS AND WHEN THE WEAPONS WERE DUG UP IN FRONT OF CASOLO
HERSELF.

   WHEN CASOLO RETURNED TO THE UNITED STATES, SHE ADMITTED THAT SHE
HAD BURIED DOCUMENTS IN THE YARD OF THE HOUSE WHERE SHE LIVED, BUT SHE
LIED BY SAYING THAT SHE DID THIS BECAUSE "IN EL SALVADOR PEOPLE
COMMONLY BURY DOCUMENTS OR JEWELS TO KEEP THEM FROM BEING STOLEN BY
CRIMINALS."

   SOURCES SAY THAT AT PRESENT, AT THE HEAD OF GROUPS OF COMMUNISTS
FROM THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES WHO SUPPORT THEIR
SALVADORAN COUNTERPARTS, CASOLO HAS BEGUN A NATIONWIDE CAMPAIGN TO
DISCREDIT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNRMENT AND TO PRESSURE CONGRESS TO
REDUCE OR ELIMINATE AID TO OUR COUNTRY IN ORDER TO WEAKEN THE COUNTRY
INSTITUTIONALLY AND STRENGTHEN THE FMLN-FDR TERRORIST GROUPS.

   THE POLICE REPORT THAT THE TERRORIST GALLARDO VALDEZ, FROM WHOM
WEAPONS AND AMMOUNITION WERE SEIZED ON 24 NOVEMBER, SAID THAT HE HAD
OBTAINED THE WEAPONS AT THE HOME OF A WOMAN WHO APPEARED TO BE A
FOREIGNER ON BARCELONA AVENUE, MIRALVALLE NEIGHBORHOOD, IN SAN
SALVADOR.

   THAT SAME DAY, POLICE INVESTIGATORS LOCATED THE HOUSE, IDENTIFIED
THE PERSON LIVING THERE, AND INVITED U.S. EMBASSY OFFICIALS TO
PARTICIPATE IN THE SEARCH.

   BURIED AT THE HOUSE THEY FOUND 103 SHELLS FOR 60-MM MORTARS, 213
STICKS OF TNT, 405 ELECTRIC DETONATING CAPS, 150 FEET OF SLOW FUSES,
15 KNIVES, 3 CARTRIDGE CLIPS FOR AK-47 RIFLES, 12,510 AK-47 SHELLS,
9,110 M-16 RIFLE SHELLS, 325 G-3 RIFLE SHELLS, AND DOCUMENTS.

   IN HER UNOFFICIAL STATEMENT, CASOLO SAID THAT SHE DID NOT BELONG TO
ANY SUBVERSIVE GROUP OR ASSOCIATION, AND THAT SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW THE
ARTICLES CAME TO BE IN HER HOUSE.

   ON 5 DECEMBER, CASOLO AND A GROUP OF SALVADORANS WERE ARRAIGNED
BEFORE A MILITARY JUDGE, WHO 5 DAYS LATER RELEASED THEM "FOR LACK OF
EVIDENCE."

   ON 9 DECEMBER, POLICEMEN ARRESTED A WOMAN NAMED RUTH ESPERANZA
AGUILAR MARROQUIN, ALIAS MARINA, WHO WAS FLEEING AFTER HAVING PLACED A
BOMB IN THE ENGINE OF A BUS. ON BEING QUESTIONED, SHE SAID SHE WAS AN
ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE PEOPLE'S REVOLUTIONARY ARMY, THAT THE PERSON IN
CHARGE OF LOGISTICS WAS THE AMERICAN, CASOLO, AND THAT SHE HAD
OBTAINED THE EXPLOSIVE MATERIAL AT CASOLO'S HOME IN MIRALVALLE.

   THE POLICE HAVE DENIED CASOLO'S CHARGES THAT DURING HER DETENTION
SHE WAS SUBJECTED TO PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TORTURE, BECAUSE IT
CAN PROVE THAT WHILE CASOLO WAS UNDER ARREST, SHE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY
AN EMBASSY OFFICIAL, EVEN AT MEALTIME.

DEV-MUC3-1080 (UNISYS)

   GUATEMALA CITY, 22 JAN 90 (LA HORA) -- [TEXT] PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO
SAID TODAY THAT "THERE WILL BE NO INCREASE IN FUEL PRICES," THUS CONFIRMING
THE STATEMENT GIVEN YESTERDAY, 21 JANUARY, BY ENERGY AND MINES MINISTER RAUL
CASTANEDA.

   THE PRESIDENT ADDED: "WHAT HAPPENED WAS A RESULT OF SPECULATION.
THE GAS STATION OWNERS EXPECTED THE PRICES WOULD INCREASE WHEN THE
QUETZAL'S EXCHANGE RATE CHANGED, BUT IT DID NOT HAPPEN."

   HE SAID THAT "THE PROBLEM WILL BE SOLVED IN A SHORT TIME BECAUSE
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC HAS TAKEN CHARGE OF THE FOREIGN
EXCHANGE DIFFERENTIAL SO THAT IT HAS NO IMPACT ON THE POPULATION."

   REFERRING TO THE WORKERS' DEMANDS FOR A SALARY INCREASE, PRESIDENT
CEREZO SAID THAT "WE ARE FACING PROBLEMS IN GRANTING THE INCREASE
BECAUSE THE 1990 BUDGET HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED."

   CEREZO ADDED: "THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH WILL MAKE THE NECESSARY
CONTACTS WITH THE CONGRESS OF THE REPUBLIC TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM BY
REQUESTING A BUDGET EXTENSION AND GETTING THE NECESSARY FUNDS TO GRANT
A SALARY INCREASE IN THE GOVERNMENT SECTOR."

   PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO WILL PERSONALLY SUPERVISE THE
INVESTIGATING COMMISSION WHICH WAS CREATED LAST WEEK TO SOLVE THE
DOUBLE MURDER PERPETRATED ON 19 JANUARY, WHICH RESULTED IN THE DEATH
OF SALVADORAN POLITICAL LEADER HECTOR OQUELI COLINDRES AND GUATEMALAN
LAWYER HILDA AMPARO FLORES AREVALO.

   THE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS PERSONALLY ISSUED BY THE PRESIDENT IN
STATEMENTS HE GAVE TO THE MEDIA THIS MORNING IN ONE OF THE NATIONAL
PALACE HALLWAYS.

   OQUELI COLINDRES WAS A MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY
MOVEMENT OF EL SALVADOR AND HE WAS ONE OF THE SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL
SECRETARIES FOR LATIN AMERICA.

   THE INVESTIGATION COMMISSION IS COMPRISED OF THREE REPRESENTATIVES
OF THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AND GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES, THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL OF THE NATION, THE HUMAN RIGHTS ATTORNEY, AND THE NATIONAL
POLICE AND TREASURY POLICE DIRECTORS GENERAL.

   PRESIDENT CEREZO SAID: "THE COMMISSION'S TASK IS TO CLEAR ALL
DOUBTS AND PROVE THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE KIDNAPPING AND SUBSEQUENT ASSASSINATION OF THESE TWO
PERSONS."

   CEREZO REASSERTED THAT "ALL DOUBTS WILL BE CLEARED UP CONCERNING
THIS GRAVE ACT OF VIOLENCE BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT HAD NO PARTICIPATION
WHATSOEVER.  THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT INTERESTED IN ELIMINATING ANYONE."

   THE INVESTIGATING COMMISSION HAS IMMEDIATELY BEGUN WORK.  THE
PRESIDENT EMPHASIZED THAT "HE WILL PERSONALLY SUPERVISE THE WORK BEING
CARRIED OUT TO GUARANTEE THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT'S FIRM INTENTION OF
NOT LETTING THIS CRIME, WHICH HAS BEEN CONDEMNED BY ALL THE SECTORS OF
THE NATION, GO UNPUNISHED."

DEV-MUC3-1085 (UNISYS)

   SAN SALVADOR, 1 FEB 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] COL GUILLERMO ALFREDO
BENAVIDES, PRIMARY PERSON IMPLICATED IN THE MURDER OF SIX JESUIT
PRIESTS AND THEIR TWO EMPLOYEES, WAS OFFICIALLY REMOVED TODAY FROM HIS
POST AS DIRECTOR OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY MILITARY SCHOOL.

   BENAVIDES' REPLACEMENT WAS PART OF A HIGH-LEVEL REORGANIZATION IN
THE ARMED FORCES WHICH, ACCORDING TO WESTERN DIPLOMATIC SOURCES,
REFLECTS AN INTENTION TO MAKE GRADUAL CHANGES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR,

   BENAVIDES, WHO IS ACCUSED OF HAVING GIVEN THE ORDER TO KILL THE
JESUITS (FIVE SPANIARDS AND ONE SALVADORAN), WILL BE REPLACED AS
DIRECTOR OF THE MILITARY SCHOOL BY COL RICARDO ALFONSO CASANOVA, WHO
WAS FORMERLY COMMANDER OF THE 6TH INFANTRY BRIGADE, BASED IN THE
EASTERN USULUTAN DEPARTMENT.

   COL HERIBERTO HERNANDEZ, WHO TO DATE HAS BEEN DIRECTOR OF THE
TREASURY POLICE, WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO USULUTAN, A DEPARTMENT WHERE
GUERRILLAS ARE CONSTANTLY ACTIVE.  HERNANDEZ WILL BE REPLACED BY COL
CIRO LOPEZ ROQUE.

   IN ADDITION TO THE MILITARY SCHOOL AND THE TREASURY POLICE, THE
CHANGES PRIMARILY AFFECT COMMANDERS IN THE AREAS OF PERSISTENT
GUERRILLA ACTIVITY, SUCH AS USULUTAN AND CHALATENANGO, AND THE ARCE
BATTALION, AN ELITE UNIT TO COMBAT THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN), WHICH IS BASED IN THE EASTERN DEPARTMENT OF
SAN MIGUEL.

   THESE TRANSFERS AND APPOINTMENTS AFFECT A TOTAL OF 12 COLONELS AND,
ALTHOUGH THE ARMED FORCES DESCRIBED THEM TODAY AS "ROUTINE CHANGES,"
DIPLOMATIC SOURCES FEEL THAT THEY ARE DESIGNED TO SEEK GREATER
EFFICIENCY IN MILITARY ACTION.  THE SOURCES FEEL THAT MORE CHANGES
WILL BE MADE THROUGHOUT THIS YEAR.

   THE FIRST RESHUFFLING IN THE ARMED FORCES FOR 1990 WAS ANNOUNCED ON
1 JANUARY, THAT IS, SHORTLY AFTER THE FMLN OFFENSIVE, THE SCALE OF
WHICH SURPRISED EVEN THE ARMY ITSELF, AS MILITARY SOURCES ADMITTED.

   ON THAT DATE, GENERAL RAFAEL BUSTILLO, CHIEF OF THE SALVADORAN
ARMED FORCES AND ONE OF THE OFFICERS MOST OPENLY OPPOSED TO DIALOGUE
WITH THE FMLN, WAS RELIEVED OF HIS DUTIES AND SENT TO EUROPE AS A
MILITARY ATTACHE.

   REPLACED WITH BUSTILLO WERE THE CHIEFS OF THE MILITARY DETACHMENTS
OF CUSCATLAN AND LA UNION, IN THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN PARTS OF THE
COUNTRY, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE CHIEF OF ARMY INTELLIGENCE.

DEV-MUC3-1093 (UNISYS)

   SAN SALVADOR, 7 FEB 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE,
CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, CATEGORICALLY DENIED
TODAY THAT THERE ARE ANY RIFTS BETWEEN SALVADORAN ARMY OFFICERS AND
U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS, AS ASSERTED THIS WEEK BY THE U.S. MEDIA.

   "I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THIS.  OUR RELATIONS WITH THE NORTH AMERICANS
ARE NORMAL AS USUAL," PONCE SAID TO JOURNALISTS, ADDING, "THE U.S.
ADVISERS HAVE HELPED US VERY MUCH IN THE PROFESSIONALIZATION OF THE
ARMED FORCES, AND THEY CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US."

   THE MILITARY OFFICER STATED: "THERE ARE ALWAYS THOSE WHO TRY TO
FORCE OR BREAK THE STRATEGIC ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES AND THE UNITED STATES."

   REPORTS FROM THE U.S. CONGRESS SAID THAT THE ARREST OF EIGHT ARMY
MEMBERS LINKED WITH THE ASSASSINATION OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS AND TWO
WOMEN ON 16 NOVEMBER HAS PROVOKED SERIOUS DISPUTES BETWEEN SOME
MILITARY COMMANDERS AND THE U.S. ADVISER CORPS DETACHED TO THE
COUNTRY.

   PONCE PARTICIPATED ON WEDNESDAY, 7 FEBRUARY, IN THE CEREMONY TO
TURN OVER COMMAND OF THE MILITARY SCHOOL TO COLONEL RICARDO CASANOVA,
REPLACING COLONEL GUILLERMO BENAVIDES, ONE OF THE MEN INVOLVED IN THE
ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUITS.

   PONCE REPORTED THAT THE MILITARY OFFICERS ACCUSED OF THE CRIME ARE
IMPRISONED AT THE NATIONAL POLICE GENERAL HEADQUARTERS, BUT THEY ARE
STILL IN ACTIVE SERVICE AND ARE RECEIVING A SALARY WHILE THE COURTS
ISSUE A RULING ON THIS CASE.

   CLANDESTINE, 11 FEB 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN)] [TEXT] TODAY, 11
FEBRUARY, AT 0900, THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE BEGAN BOMBING AND FIRING
ROCKETS AGAINST A SETTLEMENT OF REPATRIATES IN HUANCORA, SAN ISIDRO
LABRADOR JURISDICTION, CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT, WITH TWO A-37 PLANES
AND FOUR HELICOPTER GUNSHIPS, KILLING SIX PERSONS, WOUNDING THREE
OTHERS, AND DESTROYING SEVERAL HOMES.  IN VIEW OF THESE ACTIONS, THE
FMLN STATES:

   1. WE STRONGLY CONDEMN THIS COWARDLY ATTACK, WHICH WAS CARRIED OUT
PURPOSEFULLY BECAUSE THE PLACE IS COMPLETELY VISIBLE AND IDENTIFIABLE
AS AN AREA POPULATED BY REPATRIATES.

   2. THIS NEW CRIME DESTROYS THE VAUNTED FALSE IMAGE OF
PROFESSIONALISM BY THE SALVADORAN MILITARY AND SHOWS THAT THE
VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IS A DAILY PRACTICE IN THE ARMY.

   3. THIS ACTION ALSO SHOWS THE LACK OF WILL ON THE PART OF THE AIR
FORCE TO ACHIEVE A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION [TO THE CONFLICT].  THE
PERSISTENCE OF THESE CRIMES AGAINST DEFENSELESS PEOPLE CONFIRMS THE
NEED FOR US TO REMAIN ARMED AND TO USE OUR MILITARY POWER TO ACHIEVE A
NEGOTIATED SOLUTION AND PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS.

   WE CALL ON ALL HUMANITARIAN AND RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS TO PRESENT
THEMSELVES AT THE PLACE TO CONFIRM THE OCCURRENCE OF THESE ACTIONS AND
TO DENOUNCE THEM WITH FULL VIGOR.

DEV-MUC3-1103 (UNISYS)

   SAN SALVADOR, 13 FEB 90 (DPA) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT
HAS PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED ITS REGRET OVER THE DEATH OF SEVERAL CHILDREN
AND CIVILIANS IN THE GUANCORITA CANTON, CHALANTENGO DEPARTMENT, ON 11
FEBRUARY, AND HAS ORDERED AN INVESTIGATION TO CLARIFY THE CASE, WHICH
IS BEING BLAMED ON THE AIR FORCE.  THE MASSACRE TOOK PLACE AT A CAMP
OF SALVADORAN REFUGEES WHO HAD BEEN IN HONDURAS.  ACCORDING TO
RESIDENTS, SALVADORAN AIR FORCE HELICOPTERS STRAFED THE CAMP FOLLOWING
A CLASH BETWEEN GOVERNMENT TROOPS AND GUERRILLAS OF THE FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT.

   MEANWHILE, AIR FORCE COMMANDER GENERAL RAFAEL VILLAMARIONA DENIED
THE ACCUSATIONS BUT ADMITTED SOLDIERS BELONGING TO A DETACHMENT
STATIONED IN CHALANTENANGO HAD RECEIVED AIR SUPPORT. "THE
PARTICIPATION OF THE AIR FORCE IS EFFECTED ACCORDING TO REGULATIONS,
WHICH IS WHY IT COULD NOT HAVE BOMBED CIVILIANS," VILLAMARIONA SAID.

   IN THE WAKE OF THIS GRAVE INCIDENT, CHALANTENANGO DIOCESE BISHOP
MSGR. EDUARDO ALAS HELPED TO PROVIDE RELIEF TO THE WOUNDED AND HEARD
TESTIMONIES FROM RESIDENTS.  THEY SAID THAT THE HELICOPTERS HAD

80 KM NORTH OF SAN SALVADOR, AND THAT SEVERAL CIVILIANS WERE KILLED
AND AT LEAST 15 WOUNDED AS A RESULT OF THE FIGHTING.  MASS GROUPS HAVE
DEMANDED PUNISHMENT FOR THE PERSONS RESPONSIBLE, SINCE THE VICTIMS,
MOST OF THEM MINORS, WERE REPATRIATES FROM HONDURAS WHO HAD SETTLED
BETWEEN GUARJILA AND SAN JOSE LAS FLORES, WHICH IS WHERE THEY HAD COME
FROM.

   THE ARMY STATES THAT IT ALSO CAPTURED A REBEL IDENTIFIED AS ABEL
DUBON CHEVARRIA, WHO ACCORDING TO THE OFFICIAL REPORT DISCLOSED THAT

DEV-MUC3-1134 (UNISYS)

   MOSCOW (USSR), 18 FEB 90 (PRAVDA) -- [ARTICLE] [PAVEL BOGOMOLOV]
[TEXT] THE ANNALS OF THE COLOMBIAN PORT OF CARTAGENA LIST THREE
EXTREMELY FIERCE SIEGES.  BACK IN 1586, THE "JEWEL OF THE CARIBBEAN"
WAS CAPTURED BY SIR FRANCIS DRAKE, WHO DID NOT BURN THE CITY TO THE
GROUND ONLY BECAUSE HE RECEIVED A RANSOM OF 10 MILLION PESOS.  A
CENTURY LATER CARTAGENA WAS OCCUPIED BY THE FRENCH.  FINALLY, IN 1741,
THE CITY'S DEFENDERS SUCCESSFULLY FOUGHT OFF AN ASSAULT BY A HOST OF
27,000 PIRATES HEADED BY SIR EDWARD VERNON...

   THE WESTERN PRESS DESCRIBED THE MEETING BETWEEN THE PRESIDENTS OF
THE UNITED STATES, BOLIVIA, COLOMBIA, AND PERU HELD A FEW DAYS AGO IN
CARTAGENA AS A KIND OF ASSAULT.  DESPITE SOME EXAGGERATION, THIS
GRAPHIC DESCRIPTION WAS BASED ON PERFECTLY SERIOUS GROUNDS.  AFTER
ALL, THE CONFERENCE DID DISCUSS IMMEDIATE TASKS AND EVEN A DETAILED
SCHEDULE FOR A JOINT OFFENSIVE BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF THESE COUNTRIES
AGAINST CRIMINAL DRUG TRAFFICKING, WHICH RANKS FIRST IN THE PECKING
ORDER OF CRIME.

   IT IS INDEED NECESSARY TO LAUNCH AN ASSAULT AGAINST THE DRUG
MAFIA'S STRONGHOLDS, WHETHER IN MEDELLIN, "FAMOUS" FOR UNBRIDLED
GANGSTERISM, OR IN CARTAGENA ITSELF, WHOSE STATUS AS A RESORT IS
THREATENED BY THE SELFSAME "COCAINE BARONS."  AS A MATTER OF FACT,
THIS TOURIST CENTER HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY SHAKEN IN RECENT MONTHS BY THE
EXPLOSIONS OF BOMBS PLANTED BY TERRORISTS IN THE "HILTON" HOTEL, IN
STORES, OR AT ITS MARINAS.  IT IS NO WONDER, AS REUTER REPORTS, THAT
NOT A SINGLE CRUISE SHIP HAS DROPPED ANCHOR THERE THIS SEASON.

   YES, THE SITUATION IS HIGHLY ALARMING, AND THIS APPLIES TO THE
WHOLE OF COLOMBIA AND EVEN TO THE ENTIRE REGION.  IN THESE CONDITIONS
THE FIRM RESOLVE DISPLAYED BY THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE CARTAGENA
MEETING DESERVES UNDERSTANDING AND SUPPORT: THE RESOLVE TO FINALLY
POOL THEIR EFFORTS IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST ORGANIZED CRIME AND TO
JOINTLY PLACE A RELIABLE BARRIER IN ITS PATH.  THESE ARE THE
INTENTIONS SHOWN IN THE JOINT STATEMENT SIGNED BY THE FOUR PRESIDENTS
AND BY THE SERIES OF SPECIAL DOCUMENTS.

   THE AIM OF THESE AGREEMENTS IS NOBLE INDEED: TO BESIEGE THE DRUG
MAFIA IN ITS NESTS, TO CUT OFF THE "LAUNDERING" OF DRUG DOLLARS, AND
TO DEPRIVE THE MERCHANTS OF "SLOW DEATH" OF BROAD ACCESS TO THE "BLACK
MARKET" IN THE UNITED STATES, WHERE, AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE LION'S
SHARE OF SOUTH AMERICA'S POISONOUS EXPORT IS CONSUMED.  IN OTHER
WORDS, AN IMPORTANT STEP HAS BEEN TAKEN TO COMBAT ONE OF THE MAIN
"EVILS OF THE 20TH CENTURY," AND IT WAS NOT FOR NOTHING THAT THE
MEETING'S RESULTS WERE POSITIVELY APPRAISED BY UN SECRETARY GENERAL J.
PEREZ DE CUELLAR.

   HERE IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION: EMPHASIS IN CARTAGENA WAS PLACED ON
ADMINISTRATIVE AND POLICE MEASURES AND ON WASHINGTON'S PRIMARILY
MILITARIZED FORMS OF COOPERATION WITH THE ANDEAN STATES, BUT DOES THIS
CONFORM WITH THEIR LONG-TERM NATIONAL INTERESTS, WITH THEIR DESIRE TO
PUT AN END TO BACKWARDNESS AND ATTAIN A QUALITATIVELY NEW LEVEL OF
SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT?  AFTER ALL, A RADICAL SOLUTION OF THE DRUG
PROBLEM PRIMARILY DEMANDS NEITHER COMBAT AIRCRAFT NOT ARMORED
PERSONNEL CARRIERS, BUT SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT.  IT IS NECESSARY TO
CHANGE THE ECONOMIC PROFILE OF VAST PROVINCES WHERE THE CULTIVATION OF
COCA AND MARIJUANA IS THE SOLE SOURCE OF THE POPULATION'S EXISTENCE.

   TRUE ENOUGH, THE UNITED STATES HAS NOW EXPRESSED READINESS TO
ASSIST ALSO IN THIS SPHERE.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE IS AN ALMOST
TOTAL LACK OF READINESS TO IMPORT FROM SOUTH AMERICA THE CROPS WHICH
COULD, IN PRINCIPLE, SQUEEZE OUT COCA AND MARIJUANA.  IT WAS NOT FOR
NOTHING THAT COLOMBIA'S PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO, THE WHITE HOUSE'S
CLOSEST ALLY IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUGS, WAS FORCED TO DECLARE IN
CARTAGENA THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S RIGID PROTECTIONIST MEASURES ARE
JEOPARDIZING THE VERY FUTURE OF "ALTERNATIVE" SECTORS OF TROPICAL CROP
FARMING -- THE CULTIVATION OF COFFEE, FLOWERS, AND SUGAR CANE.  AND SO
THE "SENIOR PARTNER" APPEARS TO BE TIGHTENING WITH THE ONE HAND THE
VISE IN WHICH THE DRUG MAFIA NOW FINDS ITSELF, WHILE USING THE OTHER
HAND TO PROTECT ITS MARKET FROM LEGAL LATIN AMERICAN EXPORTS.

   FINALLY, THE LAST BUT, I THINK, MOST SUBSTANTIVE ARGUMENT.
ACTUALLY, IT ALSO CASTS AN UNFAVORABLE LIGHT ON THE ROLE OF CONSISTENT
FIGHTER AGAINST THE DRUG MAFIA WHICH WASHINGTON HAS NOW ASSUMED.  THIS
ARGUMENT IS PERFECTLY ENCAPSULATED IN JUST ONE SHORT WORD: "PANAMA."
INDEED, DID THE RECENT AGGRESSION AGAINST THIS SOVEREIGN STATE, ONE OF
WHOSE MAIN MOTIVES WAS ACTUALLY "TO PUNISH THE DRUG BUSINESS BOSSES,"
NOT DEMONSTRATE ALL THE FLAWS OF WASHINGTON'S "STRONGARM APPROACH"
TOWARD LATIN AMERICA?  AND ARE THERE ANY GUARANTEES THAT THE PENTAGON
WILL NOT START "COPYING" ITS PANAMANIAN EXPERIENCE IN OTHER COUNTRIES
IN THE CONTINENT ON THE PRETEXT OF PURSUING THE "COCAINE BARONS"?

   THESE ARE FAR FROM RHETORICAL QUESTIONS, AND IT IS A PITY THAT
CARTAGENA SIMPLY FAILED TO PROVIDE EVEN THE SLIGHTEST CLEAR-CUT
ANSWERS TO THEM.

DEV-MUC3-1139 (UNISYS)

   MEDELLIN, 24 FEB 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] TWO U.S. CITIZENS, WHO HAD BEEN
KIDNAPPED BY GUERRILLAS ON 12 FEBRUARY IN ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT IN
NORTHWESTERN COLOMBIA, WERE RELEASED TODAY.

   JAMUS ARTHUR DONELLY, AN AUTOMOTIVE SPARE PARTS SALESMAN, AND
PROFESSOR DAVIS LESLIE KENT, WHO SPOKE TO NEWSMEN IN MEDELLIN,
REVEALED A MESSAGE FROM THE PRO-CASTROITE ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION,
(ELN) WHICH HELD THEM HOSTAGE FOR 12 DAYS.

   "THE NEXT TIME THERE IS A MASSACRE OR THE GOVERNMENT CAUSES THE
DISAPPEARANCE OF ONE OF OUR COMPANIONS, SUCH AS JUAN FERNANDO PORRAS,
THE ELN WILL PUNISH THE WEALTHY PEOPLE, THE OLIGARCHY OF COLOMBIA,"
THE EXTREMIST GROUP'S MESSAGE STATED.  BOTH DONELLY, 62, AS WELL AS
KENT, 40, SAID THEY WERE TREATED WELL BY THE REBELS, WITH WHOM THEY
HAD BROAD DISCUSSIONS ON THE SITUATION IN COLOMBIA.

   ACCORDING TO THE TWO U.S. CITIZENS, THE ELN KIDNAPPED THEM AS PART
OF THE SO-CALLED "OPERATION COLOMBIA" TO PROTEST THE RECENT PRESENCE
OF U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH IN COLOMBIA, WHICH HOSTED THE RECENT 15
FEBRUARY ARTIDRUG SUMMIT IN CARTAGENA, AND WHAT THEY CALLED
"INCREASING U.S. INTERVENTION IN COLOMBIA."

   DONELLY AND KENT WERE TURNED OVER BY THE ELN TO A COMMISSION MADE
UP OF OFFICIALS OF THE ANTIOQUIA REGIONAL ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE
AND MEMBERS OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION IN A REGION NEAR COCORNA,
80 KM SOUTHEAST OF MEDELLIN.

DEV-MUC3-1145 (UNISYS)

   SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY MODERATOR AND REPORTERS] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] [CRISTIANI] AND, THEREFORE, IT DOES NOT SEEM LIKE IT IS A
TOTAL ADVANCEMENT IN A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IT IS NOT
VERY DEMOCRATIC TO HAVE THE ARMED FORCES OF A COUNTRY UNDER THE
CONTROL OF ONE OF ITS POLITICAL PARTIES.  THE ARMED FORCES OF A
COUNTRY SHOULD RESPOND TO THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND TO THE GOVERNMENT
THAT IS LEGITIMATELY ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE.  AND THEREFORE, THIS WOULD
CURTAIL THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE OF THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE IN TRYING TO
CONTROL AND GOVERN THE COUNTRY, EVEN THOUGH IT IS NOT FROM THE
POSITION OF BEING PRESIDENT OF THE COUNTRY.  SECONDLY, I THINK THAT I
HAVE MENTIONED BEFORE THAT IT IS NOT THE RESULT OF THE ELECTION THAT
WILL CHANGE OUR ATTITUDE WITH RESPECT TO OUR DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH
NICARAGUA, BUT RATHER THE ATTITUDE OF THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT WITH
RESPECT TO AID TO THE FMLN, TO THE MARXIST GUERRILLAS IN EL SALVADOR.
AND IN THIS CASE WE STILL HAVE NOT SEEN THAT CHANGE TAKING PLACE.
OBVIOUSLY, WE FEEL THAT WITH MRS CHAMORRO AS PRESIDENT OF NICARAGUA
THAT THIS AID WILL STOP AND THEREFORE MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE
RESUMPTION OF NORMAL RELATIONS BETWEEN EL SALVADOR AND NICARAGUA, BUT
IT IS THAT ATTITUDE THAT WOULD MAKE A CHANGE AND NOT NECESSARILY THE
RESULT IN ITSELF.

   WITH RESPECT TO THE THIRD QUESTION, OBVIOUSLY I THINK THAT IF MRS
CHAMORRO REALLY IS IN CONTROL, IN TOTAL CONTROL, ESPECIALLY OF THE
SANDINISTA ARMY, THAT THERE WILL BE A STOP IN AID, AND THEREFORE THE
FMLN WOULD NOT HAVE NICARAGUA'S LOGISTICAL AND MILITARY SUPPORT FOR
THEM.  AND THEREFORE, THIS CERTAINLY AFFECTS THEM.

   [REPORTER, IN ENGLISH] I THINK THAT ABOUT ONE WEEK AGO OR TWO WEEKS
AGO IN THE WASHINGTON POST THERE WAS A REPORT THAT COLONEL BENAVIDES
WAS LIVING A RATHER LUXURIOUS LIFE.  I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU HAVE SEEN
THAT PIECE.  AND ALSO THE U.S. AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER HAS SAID THAT
HE FELT THAT IT WAS TIME THAT, WELL, THE ARTICLE IMPLIES THAT THERE
WAS SOME PRESSURE, OR THERE WAS SOME PROTECTION COMING FROM THE
TANDONA [REFERENCE TO THE 1966 GRADUATING CLASS OF THE CAPTAIN GENERAL
GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMY] TO PROTECT BENAVIDES, BECAUSE HE
[WORDS INDISTINCT] THEIR MEN AND THAT SOME LOWER LIEUTENANTS WERE NOT
GOING TO BE RECEIVING ANY SORT OF PROTECTION AND THEY MAY HAVE TO TAKE
THE FAULT FOR WHAT HAS HAPPENED.  AND ALSO WILLIAM WALKER HAD SAID
THAT HE FELT THAT IT WAS TIME FOR SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN THE TANDONA TO
STEP DOWN AND FOR OTHER OFFICERS TO MOVE UP.  WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT
THAT [WORD INDISTINCT]?  SHOULD THERE BE THAT KIND OF PRESSURE?
SHOULD SOME OF THE GUYS IN THE TANDONA STEP DOWN FROM THEIR POSTS?

   [CRISTIANI, IN ENGLISH] WELL, I THINK THAT IT IS NOT REALLY THE
DETERMINING FACTOR WHETHER YOU BELONG TO A SPECIFIC GRADUATING CLASS
WITHIN THE ARMED FORCES THAT SHOULD BE WHAT DETERMINES WHETHER YOU
CONTINUE OR NOT, OR BE REMOVED OR NOT FROM THE ARMED FORCES.  IT IS
YOUR OWN PERFORMANCE AND YOUR OWN BEHAVIOR THAT SHOULD BE THE
DETERMINING FACTOR.

   SO, THEREFORE, IT IS NOT NECESSARILY THAT THE TANDONA PEOPLE, JUST
FOR BEING MEMBERS OF THE GRADUATING CLASS, [CHUCKLES] THAT ACTION
SHOULD BE TAKEN AGAINST THEM.  SO I THINK THAT IN THAT CASE THAT IS
NOT REALLY THE POINT.

   WITH RESPECT TO THE OTHER CASE, I THINK IT IS NOW IN THE HANDS OF
THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY ON HOW IT GOES, WHAT TYPE OF
DEFENSE THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN ARRAIGNED HAVE.  I THINK THAT THEY ALL
ARE RECEIVING THE LEGAL SUPPORT IN THE CASE AND THE OTHER [WORDS
INDISTINCT].

   [REPORTER, IN ENGLISH] AS FOR THE DIALOGUE WITH THE GUERRILLAS,
BEFORE YOU LEFT FOR TAIWAN YOU CONDITIONED THE DIALOGUE ON A CEASING
OF ACTS OF VIOLENCE.  TO BE SPECIFIC, DOES THIS MEAN [WORDS
INDISTINCT] ALL ACTS OF VIOLENCE?  AND ALSO, WHEN DO YOU THINK THAT
THIS DIALOGUE CAN ACTUALLY TAKE PLACE?

   [CRISTIANI, IN ENGLISH] WELL, IF WE COULD TRY AND PUT INTO ONE
BASKET AND CALL THAT BASKET WITH A NAME WITH RESPECT TO THE ACTIONS,
WE ARE ASKING THE FMLN TO STOP TERRORIST ACTIVITIES, BECAUSE TERRORIST
ACTIVITY IS AFFECTING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  YOU JUST MENTIONED THE
FACT ABOUT A POLE THAT THEY USE FOR ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION IN THE
COUNTRY.  JUST LAST NIGHT THEY BLEW UP ONE AND THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE
HURT.  TWO CIVILIANS THAT WERE PASSING BY WERE HURT BY THAT EXPLOSION.
SO THAT IS WHAT HAS TO STOP.  THE FMLN HAS TO STOP ALL TERRORIST
ACTIVITY, BECAUSE THAT IS THE ACTIVITY THAT HURTS THE CIVILIAN
POPULATION.  THAT IS NOT MILITARY ACTIVITY.  THAT IS SOMETHING GEARED
AGAINST OR TO CONFRONT THE ARMED FORCES.  SO IT IS THAT VIOLENCE THAT
CAN BE SUMMED UP IN WHAT IS CALLED TERRORISM THAT WE ARE ASKING FOR --
THOSE ACTIVITIES THAT REALLY AFFECT THE CIVILIAN POPULATION OF THE
COUNTRY.  [CONTINUED]

DEV-MUC3-1161 (SYNCHRONETICS)

   BOGOTA, 8 MAR 90 (DPA) -- [TEXT] IT HAS BEEN OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED
THAT COLOMBIAN AND VENEZUELAN AUTHORITIES DEALT A HARSH BLOW TO THE
GUERRILLA ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION (ELN) WHEN, IN A BORDER REGION,
THEY BROKE UP A REBEL COLUMN THAT OPERATED IN BOTH COUNTRIES.

   THE MILITARY OPERATIVE LED TO THE CAPTURE OF 12 ELN MEMBERS WHO HAD
KIDNAPPED SEVERAL CATTLE BREEDERS AND PROPERTY-OWNERS IN THE BORDER
AREA.

   ONE OF THE GUERILLAS, ROBERTO ALBARRACIN RODRIGUEZ, WAS CAPTURED IN
THE VENEZUELAN TOWN OF RUASDUALITO BY MEMBERS OF THE VENEZUELAN
JUDICIAL TECHNICAL POLICE (PTJ), WHILE COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES CAPTURED
11 OTHERS IN THE EASTERN ARAUCA DEPARTMENT.

   THE ELN, THE MOST RADICAL OF ALL THE ARMED GROUPS OPERATING IN
COLOMBIA, HAS THREATENED TO SABOTAGE NEXT SUNDAY'S MUNICIPAL AND
LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS.

   OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS, ELN FRONTS HAVE KIDNAPPED SEVERAL MAYORS,
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, AND CATTLE BREEDERS, AND THEY HAVE STOLEN
PEASANTS' IDENTITY CARDS, WITHOUT WHICH THEY CANNOT VOTE.

   NO CITY, NO DATE (FBIS) -- [TEXT] 

COLOMBIA: DRUG KINGPINS SOLE MEMBERS OF 'EXTRADITABLES'

   THE 22 JANUARY EDITION OF THE BOGOTA DAILY EL TIEMPO PUBLISHED
INFORMATION FROM COLOMBIAN POLICE INTELLIGENCE REPORTS AND STATE
SECURITY INTERCEPTS IDENTIFYING DRUG KINGPINS PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA
AND JORGE LUIS OCHOA VASQUE AS THE ONLY MEMBERS OF THE SO-CALLED
"EXTRADITABLES."  THIS PRESS NOTE PROVIDES HIGHLIGHTS OF THE 22
JANUARY ARTICLE.

   DRUG BARONS PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA AND JORGE LUIS OCHOA VASQUE, WHO
ARE REPUTED TO BE THE BRAINS BEHIND THE MEDELLIN CARTEL'S PLAN TO
SURRENDER TO THE GOVERNMENT, HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE NATIONAL
POLICE AND STATE SECURITY AS THE ONLY ONES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
COMMUNIQUES SENT BY THE SO-CALLED "EXTRADITABLES," ACCORDING TO THE EL
TIEMPO ARTICLE.

   STATE SECURITY RECOGNI ED ESCOBAR'S VOICE IN A CONVERSATION
INTERCEPTED DURING A ROUTINE RADIO SCANNING OPERATION, WHICH REVEALED
THAT THE CARTEL WAS PLANNING TO SURRENDER TO THE GOVERNMENT.  ESCOBAR
WAS ACTING AS THE CARTEL'S INTERMEDIARY IN CHARGE OF CONTACTING LAWYER
GUIDO PARRA, THE LIAISON BETWEEN THE CARTEL AND HIGH LEVEL GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS.  ESCOBAR DID NOT DISCLOSE THE NAMES OF THE OFFICIALS
INVOLVED.

   A NATIONAL POLICE INTELLIGENCE REPORT SAYS THAT OCHOA AND ESCOBAR
FIND THEMSELVES IN A PRECARIOUS SITUATION BECAUSE OTHER TRAFFICKER
GROUPS HAVE WITHDRAWN THEIR SUPPORT AS THEY DO NOT WANT TO BE HELD
ACCOUNTABLE FOR KIDNAPPINGS AND OTHER TERRORIST ACTS THEY HAVE NOT
PERPETRATED.  THE REPORT FURTHER INDICATES THAT ESCOBAR, PRESSURED BY
MILITARY OPERATIONS IN ANTIOQUIA, "WAS FORCED TO ORDER THE KIDNAPPINGS
OF ALVARO DIEGO MONTOYA, (SON OF THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE
PRESIDENCY) AND PATRICIA ECHEVARRIA (SISTER OF PRESIDENT BARCO'S
SON-IN-LAW) AND HER DAUGHTER."  THESE HIGH PROFILE HOSTAGES SERVED AS
A "PROTECTIVE SHIELD," ACCORDING TO THE ARTICLE.

   SPOKESMEN FOR THE INTELLIGENCE CORPS ARE QUOTED AS SAYING THAT
ESCOBAR KNEW THAT BY TAKING HOSTAGE THE SON OF THE SECRETARY GENERAL
OF THE PRESIDENCY, HE COULD SUCCESSFULLY EXERT THE PRESSURE HE NEEDED
TO ACT IN THE NAME OF THE "EXTRADITABLES."  PROBLEMS BEGAN TO SURFACE
SOON AFTER THE CARTEL'S SURRENDER, AS MEMBERS AT ODDS WITH ESCOBAR
STARTED TO BREAK AWAY FROM THE GROUP.  ACCORDING TO MEDELLIN
OFFICIALS, THE KIDNAPPINGS OF MONTOYA AND ECHEVARRIA ALSO HAD AN
IMPACT ON THE RATE OF ATTRITION AMONG THE "EXTRADITABLES.

   THE CARTEL'S SURRENDER IS NOT SEEN AS A SURPRISE: THE 4TH ARMY
BRIGADE WAS CONDUCTING AN EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH OF THE ANTIOQUIA
DEPARTMENT IN AN EFFORT TO BRING THE KINGPINS TO JUSTICE.  MOREOVER,
THE ARMY LAUNCHED A PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN AMONG THE LOCALS TO ENCOURAGE
THEM TO INFORM AGAINST THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS.  FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF
JOSE GON ALO RODRIGUE GACHA, ESCOBAR AND OCHOA WERE CONSTANTLY ON THE
MOVE.

   A SPOKESMAN FOR STATE SECURITY STATES THAT SOPHISTICATED
COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT IN MEDELLIN ENABLED THEM TO LEARN ABOUT
ESCOBAR'S INTENTIONS ALMOST ON A DAILY BASIS.  IT WAS DIFFICULT TO
ESTABLISH THEIR EXACT WHEREABOUTS, HOWEVER, BECAUSE THEY NEVER
REMAINED IN ONE PLACE FOR MORE THAN SIX HOURS AT A TIME.  THE TWO DRUG
BARONS ALWAYS TRAVELED WITH AN ESCORT OF SIX TO EIGHT MEN WHOM THEY
TRUSTED IMPLICITLY.

   ACCORDING TO A HIGH-RANKING MILITARY OFFICIAL, "WHEN ESCOBAR BEGAN
LOSING POWER IN MEDELLIN, HIS CLOSEST AIDES, FEARING PERSECUTION, WENT
INTO HIDING."  HE ADDS THAT ESCOBAR AND OCHOA TOOK ON THE CAUSE OF
TRAFFICKERS WANTED BY THE UNITED STATES, BUT NOTES, "WE ARE WELL AWARE
OF THE FACT THAT THE CALI CARTEL MEN DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY."

   THE EL TIEMPO ARTICLE NOTES THAT ON 19 JANUARY SEVERAL LEADING
COLOMBIAN NEWSPAPERS CIRCULATED A NOTICE POINTING TO ESCOBAR AS THE
MAN WHO ACTS IN THE NAME OF THE "EXTRADITABLES."  LATER, IT WAS
CONFIRMED THAT THE AUTHORSHIP OF THE NOTICE WAS ATTRIBUTED TO A
DEMENTED PERSON WHOSE NAME HAD CLEARLY BEEN USED.  EL TIEMPO ASKS:.
"COULD THIS BE A MESSAGE FROM OTHER DRUG TRAFFICKERS WHO ARE UNWILLING
TO PAY FOR PABLO ESCOBAR'S ACTIONS?  COULD IT BE A MESSAGE FROM THESE
SAME TRAFFICKERS WHO DO NOT WANT TO GIVE UP THIS BUSINESS AND
THEREFORE ARE UNWILLING TO HAVE ESCOBAR AND OCHOA SPEAK FOR THEM?"

DEV-MUC3-1177 (SYNCHRONETICS)

   BOGOTA, NO DATE (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [INTERVIEW WITH LEMOS BY
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [REPORTER] JARAMILLO OSSA
HAS SAID THAT FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS HE HAD ASKED THE GOVERNMENT FOR
PROTECTION, THAT HIS LIFE WAS IN DANGER, AND THAT HE HELD THE
GOVERNMENT DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR WHATEVER HAPPENED TO HIM.  THAT IS
WHAT JARAMILLO OSSA SAID.

   [LEMOS] DID YOU SAY FOR THE PAST 4 YEARS?

   [REPORTER] THAT IS WHAT JARAMILLO OSSA SAID, THAT THE GOVERNMENT
WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS SAFETY DURING THE PAST 4 YEARS.  HE ALSO SAID
THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED FROM THEN ON WOULD ALSO BE BLAMED ON YOUR
STATEMENT, AND THAT THE BEST SERVICE YOU COULD GIVE THE COUNTRY WOULD
BE TO RESIGN.

   [LEMOS] I ALREADY REPLIED TO A QUESTION ABOUT MY RESIGNATION.  I
CANNOT RESIGN BECAUSE I AM NOT GUILTY.  BY RESIGNING I WOULD BE
ADMITTING MY GUILT TO SOMETHING I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH.  HOWEVER, I
AM GLAD THAT YOU MENTIONED THAT THIS HAS BEEN OCCURRING FOR THE PAST 4
YEARS.  I WAS A JOURNALIST FOUR YEARS AGO.

   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] MADE A MISTAKE A FEW DAYS AGO BY
AGAIN LINKING THE UP WITH THE FARC?

   [LEMOS] I PREFER NOT TO DISCUSS THIS TOPIC NOW.  I DO NOT THINK
THAT THIS IS THE BEST TIME TO DISCUSS THAT SUBJECT.

   AFTER THIS SITUATION HAS SETTLED, I WILL HAVE TO FILE A FORMAL
STATEMENT AT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WHERE I HAVE BEEN SUMMONED
BY THE UP.  AS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, I AM OBLIGED TO APPEAR BEFORE
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO EXPLAIN MY ACTIONS, BUT NOW IS NOT
THE MOMENT TO EXPLAIN ANYTHING.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [LEMOS] OF COURSE, THE PRESIDENT IS VERY DISTRESSED, AS WE ALL ARE.
WE BELIEVE THIS IS A TERRIBLE; THERE IS NO JUSTIFICATION FOR SOMETHING
LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN.  IT IS EVIDENT THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE SEEKING A GOAL
OPPOSITE TO THAT OF THE GOVERNMENT ARE INVOLVED IN THIS.  THE
GOVERNMENT WANTS A FREE ELECTORAL PROCESS; IT IS COMMITTED TO THAT.

   TODAY, WHEN WE HAVE A COMPLETELY ORDERLY ELECTORAL PROCESS, IT
WOULD BE ABSURD, ILLOGICAL, IRRATIONAL, AND SENSELESS FOR THE
GOVERNMENT TO PROMOTE ACTIONS THAT RUN COUNTER TO ITS GOAL OF ENSURING
THAT ITS TERM ENDS IN PEACE AND THAT THE ELECTIONS WILL TAKE PLACE
NORMALLY.

   [REPORTER] THE UP HAS AGAIN CAST DOUBT OVER THE GOVERNMENT'S
GUARANTEES FOR THE CANDIDATES AND THE PARTY.

   [LEMOS] I BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS DONE EVERYTHING HUMANLY
POSSIBLE TO GUARANTEE THE SAFETY OF CANDIDATES, NOT ONLY THE SAFETY OF
UP MEMBERS, BUT OF ALL PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES, REGARDLESS OF THEIR
AFFILIATION.

   [WORDS INDISTINCT] IN THEIR COMMUNIQUE, EVIDENCE OF THE FACT THAT
DR JARAMILLO'S BODYGUARDS REACTED AND, I UNDERSTAND, BY KILLING ONE OF
THE ASSASSINS, AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT I HAVE HEARD, AND ARRESTED
ANOTHER ONE, WHICH HAS BEEN CONFIRMED, SHOWS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS
INDEED OFFERING PROTECTION.

   THEREFORE, DR. JARAMILLO WAS INDEED ENJOYING GOVERNMENT PROTECTION
JUST AS THE OTHER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ARE.  WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT
THE ASSASSINS CARRY OUT SURPRISE ATTACKS.  AT A GIVEN MOMENT, AN
APPROACHING PERSON CAN CAN PULL OUT A WEAPON AND KILL WHOMEVER HE
WANTS.  THERE IS NO 100-PERCENT PREVENTION AGAINST THIS.  THIS HOLDS
TRUE NOT ONLY IN COLOMBIA BUT IN MANY COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD.  THE
VERY COURSE OF THESE TERRIBLE EVENTS OF THIS MORNING AT THE AIPORT
SHOW THAT DR JARAMILLO WAS INDEED PROTECTED.

   [REPORTER] THE UP HAS JUST ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL FILE SUIT AGAINST
YOU FOR THIS ASSASSINATION.

   [LEMOS] THAT IS FINE.  IF THE UP HAS ANY EVIDENCE THAT I AM
INVOLVED IN DR. JARAMILLO'S ASSASSINATION, THEN IT MUST FILE SUIT,
BECAUSE OTHERWISE, IT WOULD BE ACTING AS AN ACCOMPLICE TO THIS
ASSASSINATION.  I BELIEVE THAT SUITS MUST BE FILED BY THOSE WHO
SUSPECT THAT A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, AND MYSELF PARTICULARLY, MAY BE
INVOLVED IN THE ASSASSINATION, TO ENSURE THAT THE INCIDENT IS
INVESTIGATED.  THEREFORE, I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS GOOD NEWS AMID A SEA
OF BAD NEWS THAT WE HAVE HEARD TODAY.

   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] ONLY RESPONSIBILITY FOR PHYSICAL
SAFETY, BUT THERE IS ALSO POLITICAL RESPONSIBILITY.  YOU ARE BEING
ACCUSED OF POLITICAL IRRESPONSIBILITY AND OF NOT RESPONSIBILE FOR
PHYSICAL SAFETY.  [CONTINUED]

DEV-MUC3-1181 (SYNCHRONETICS)

   SAN SALVADOR, 22 MAR 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] OTTO SORTO MILLA, THE
SON-IN-LAW OF GENERAL RAFAEL VILLAMARIONA, CHIEF OF THE SALVADORAN AIR
FORCE, WAS WOUNDED IN AN ATTACK IN SAN SALVADOR TODAY AND IS IN
"SERIOUS CONDITION," ACCORDING TO MILITARY SPOKESMEN AND DOCTORS.

   THE SOURCES POINTED OUT THAT SORTO MILLA, 25, WAS MACHINEGUNNED
FROM A MOVING VEHICLE WHILE LEAVING HIS HOME, LOCATED IN THE LUXURIOUS
SAN FRANCISCO NEIGHBORHOOD IN SOUTHWEST SAN SALVADOR.

   DOCTORS TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT GEN. VILLAMARIONA'S SON-IN-LAW IS "IN
SERIOUS CONDITION" AT A PRIVATE HOSPITAL, WHERE HE WAS ADMITTED AT
1030 (1630 GMT), BUT THEY DID NOT SPECIFY WHERE THE BULLET WOUNDS WERE
OR THE NUMBER OF BULLETS THAT HIT HIM.

   MILITARY SPOKESMEN SAID THAT SORTO MILLA HAD BULLET WOUNDS IN
SEVERAL PARTS OF THE BODY, BUT THEY REFUSED TO PROVIDE MORE DETAILS AS
LONG AS THE POLICE ARE CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS TO CAPTURE THE
ASSAILANTS.

   GEN. VILLAMARIONA, CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF THE HARD-LINE MILITARY
CHIEFS OF THE ARMED FORCES, WAS APPOINTED TO HIS PRESENT POST IN
JANUARY OF THIS YEAR REPLACING GENERAL RAFAEL BUSTILLO, WHO WAS
APPOINTED MILITARY ATTACHE IN ISRAEL.

   THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE (FAS) PLAYED A KEY ROLE DURING THE LAST
GUERRILLA MILITARY OFFENSIVE IN NOVEMBER 1989, AND IT WAS ACCUSED BY
OPPOSITION GROUPS, HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS, AND THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
OF INDISCRIMINATELY BOMBING POOR NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE CAPITAL TO
DISLODGE REPORTED GUERRILLA REDOUBTS.

   THE ATTACK ON SORTO MILLA TOOK PLACE A WEEK AFTER THE FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) SUSPENDED ITS ATTACKS ON
CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE CREATION OF
CONDITIONS FOR THE RESUMPTION OF THE DIALOGUE WITH PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT.

   OFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE NOT DISCLOSED WHO THEY BELIEVE CARRIED OUT
THE ATTACK OR PROVIDED ANY BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON SORTO MILLA.

   MEDELLIN, 23 MAR 90 (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [TEXT] DIEGO MONTANA
CUELLAR, PRESIDENT OF THE PATRIOTIC UNION [UP], HAS RECEIVED A LETTER SIGNED
BY PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA, IN WHICH HE EMPHATICALLY DENIES ANY PARTICIPATION
IN THE ASSASSINATION OF BERNARDO JARAMILLO OSSA.

   THE LETTER, WHICH CARRIES ESCOBAR GAVIRIA'S SIGNATURE AND
FINGERPRINT, WAS ALSO SENT TO THE MEDELLIN MEDIA.

   IN HIS LETTER TO THE UP, ESCOBAR GAVIRIA STATED: I ALWAYS LIKED,
ADMIRED, AND RESPECTED BERNARDO JARAMILLO.

   ESCOBAR GAVIRIA DISCLOSED THAT HE MET SEVERAL TIMES TO INTERCEDE
WITH GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA TO ENSURE THAT JARAMILLO OSSA'S LIFE
WOULD BE RESPECTED.  ESCOBAR GAVIRIA ADDED: THIS CAN BE CONFIRMED BY
MANY MEMBERS OF JARAMILLO OSSA'S POLITICAL MOVEMENT AND EVEN BY SOME
OF HIS DAS [ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY] BODYGUARDS WHO WERE
WITNESSES AT THOSE MEETINGS.  [SENTENCE AS HEARD]

   IN HIS LETTER TO MONTANA CUELLAR, ESCOBAR GAVIRIA SAID HE WAS
AMAZED BY HOW EASILY AND QUICKLY THE GOVERNMENT HAS FOUND SOMEONE TO
BLAME.

   STATE SECURITY AGENCY SPOKESMEN SAID ON 22 MARCH THAT THEY HAVE
PROOF LINKING ESCOBAR GAVIRIA TO THE ASSASSINATION. THE ASSOCIATED
PRESS [AP] HAS ALSO RECEIVED TELEPHONE CALLS IN WHICH AN ALLEGED
SPOKESMEN OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE
ASSASSINATION OF JARAMILLO OSSA.

   IN HIS LETTER TO THE UP, ESCOBAR GAVIRIA DISAVOWS THOSE CALLS,
STATING: WHY SHOULD I ATTACK SOMEONE WHO WAS FIRMLY OPPOSED TO
COLOMBIA SURRENDERING TO THE UNITED STATES?

DEV-MUC3-1197 (SYNCHRONETICS)

   BOGOTA, 29 MAR 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE REFORMIST SECTOR OF THE LEFTIST
PATRIOTIC UNION (UP) TODAY RESIGNED FROM THE PARTY'S NATIONAL COORDINATING
BOARD, CREATING AN UNPRECEDENTED CRISIS IN ITS FIVE YEARS OF POLITICAL LIFE.

   DURING THE SECOND DAY OF ITS PLENUM, TWELVE OF ITS 20 MEMBERS,
INCLUDING UP PRESIDENT DIEGO MONTANA CUELLAR, RESIGNED FROM THE
NATIONAL COORDINATING BOARD, WHICH ALSO INCLUDES ACTIVISTS OF THE
COMMUNIST PARTY OF COLOMBIA (PCC).

   ACCORDING TO SOURCES CLOSE TO THE UP, THE REFORMIST FACTION
RESIGNED FROM THE COORDINATING BOARD BECAUSE IT BELIEVES THAT WHAT IS
NEEDED IN COLOMBIA IS A BROAD SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT, SUCH AS THAT
ADVOCATED BY UP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BERNARDO JARAMILLO OSSA, WHO
WAS ASSASSINATED ON 22 MARCH.

   THE LEFTIST SOURCES CONSULTED BY EFE INDICATED TODAY THAT THE
POSSIBILITY OF PARTICIPATING IN THE 27 MAY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, AT
LEAST WITH A JOINT UP AND PCC CANDIDATE, IS GROWING MORE DISTANT.

   WHILE THE UP'S REFORMIST FACTION REJECTS THE ARMED PATH AS A MEANS
TO ACHIEVE POWER, THE SECTOR KNOWN AS THE RADICALS, IN OTHER WORDS,
THE EIGHT MEMBERS WHO DID NOT RESIGN FROM THE COORDINATING BOARD,
AGREE ON USING DIFFERENT FORMS OF STRUGGLE, INCLUDING GUERRILLA
STRUGGLE.

   THE EIGHT MEMBERS WHO DID NOT RESIGN BELONG TO THE PCC.

   IN ADDITION TO MONTANA, LEADERS ANGELINO GARZON, GUILLERMO
BANGUERO, ALBERTO ROJAS PUYO, JULIO SANTANA, AND LUIS EMIRO VALENCIA
WERE AMONG THOSE WHO RESIGNED.

   AT THE SAME TIME, 12 MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE, ANOTHER
SECTION OF THE PARTY, ALSO RESIGNED.  THEY ARE ALSO FROM THE REFORMIST
FACTION.

   THE FRICTION WITH THE REFORMISTS OR PERESTROYKA SUPPORTERS BEGAN ON
28 MARCH, THE FIRST DAY OF SESSIONS OF THE PLENUM, WHEN ANGELINO
GARZON CHARGED THAT THE PCC HAD INTERCEPTED JARAMILLO OSSA'S LETTERS.

   ANOTHER REASON FOR THE DIVISION WITHIN THE COLOMBIAN LEFT WAS THE
NOT VERY FAVORABLE RESULTS IN THE 11 MARCH LEGISLATIVE AND MUNICIPAL
ELECTIONS, WHEN THE UP AND THE PCC LOST SEVERAL SEATS IN THE COLOMBIAN
CONGRESS.

   UP TO 22 MARCH, THE DAY WHEN JARAMILLO WAS ASSASSINATED, HE WAS THE
SINGLE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OF THE UP AND THE PCC, BUT AFTER HIS
DEATH, BOTH PARTIES AGREED TO HOLD A PLENUM TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY
WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTIONS.

DEV-MUC3-1201 (SYNCHRONETICS)

   SAN SALVADOR, 2 APR 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] OFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE
REPORTED THAT FIVE POLICEMEN AND A CIVILIAN WERE KILLED, AND AT LEAST
24 SOLDIERS INJURED WHEN A VEHICLE LOADED WITH EXPLOSIVES EXPLODED ON
2 APRIL NEAR A POLICE PRECINCT LOCATED ON THE SOUTHWESTERN OUTSKIRTS
OF SAN SALVADOR.

   THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE (COPREFA) CONFIRMED THAT THE
TERRORIST ATTACK OCCURRED AT 0615 (1315 GMT) [AS RECEIVED] ON MONDAY
IN SANTA TECLA, 12 KM FROM THE CAPITAL.

   THE OFFICIAL REPORT REVEALS THAT A COMPANY OF POLICEMEN FROM THE
TECHNICAL POLICE INSTRUCTION CENTER, AN AGENCY OF THE NATIONAL POLICE,
WAS EXERCISING NEAR THE PRECINCT WHEN A POWERFUL EXPLOSIVE CHARGE IN A
PICK-UP TRUCK WENT OFF AS THE POLICEMAN WENT BY.  A COPREFA SPOKESMAN
HAS SUGGESTED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS PROBABLY ACTIVATED BY REMOTE
CONTROL BY A GUERRILLA UNIT.

DEV-MUC3-1207 (SYNCHRONETICS)

   SAN SALVADOR, 3 APR 90 (RADIO CADENA YSKL) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH
COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS
OF STAFF, BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS] [EXCERPTS] [REPORTER] WHAT IS THE
POSITION OF THE ARMED FORCES CONCERNING THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT IN
NICARAGUA AND THE UPCOMING DIALOGUE TO BE HELD IN GENEVA BETWEEN THE
REBELS AND THE GOVERNMENT?  WILL THE ARMED FORCES SEEK SUPPORT FOR THE
DIALOGUE AND A SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT?

   [PONCE] LAST WEEK THE ARMED FORCES RELEASED A PUBLIC MESSAGE TO THE
PEOPLE EXPLAINING THEIR STAND AND MENTIONING THREE BASIC POINTS:

   FIRST, THE ARMED FORCES SUPPORT A DIALOGUE THAT SEEKS PEACE IN THE
COUNTRY THROUGH MECHANISMS OF UNDERSTANDING AND AGREEMENT.

   SECOND, THE ARMED FORCES EXPRESS THEIR LOYALTY TO THE PRESIDENT OF
THE REPUBLIC IN THESE EFFORTS AND OTHER EFFORTS HE MAY UNDERTAKE TO
FIND THE PEACE WE ALL CHERISH IN THIS COUNTRY.

   THIRD, WE POSSESS THE MORAL CONVICTION AND THE OBEDIENCE -- AS
ORDERED BY THE CONSTITUTION -- AS WELL AS THE HUMANISTIC AWARENESS TO
PROMOTE AND PROTECT THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF ALL SALVADORANS.

   THOSE ARE THE BASIC POINTS INCLUDED IN OUR MESSAGE TO THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE THAT WE ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK.

   AS FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT BEING HELD IN NICARAGUA, THE ARMED
FORCES WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT THE EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN BY OUR GOVERNMENT
TO FIND THE MECHANISMS THAT WILL LEAD US TO PEACE IN THE REGION.  THAT
IS WHY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC HAS OUR FULL SUPPORT IN THIS
ENDEAVOUR FOR FINDING PEACE AND DEMOCRACY THROUGHOUT CENTRAL AMERICA.

   CONCERNING THE DIALOGUE IN GENEVA, I BELIEVE THAT TOMORROW THERE
WILL BE A BRIEFING WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF DELEGATES FROM THE
GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT]
TOGETHER WITH THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL, WHO WILL ANNOUNCE THE
MECHANISMS TO BE FOLLOWED IN THIS DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND
THE FMLN.

   [REPORTER] WHAT DO THE ARMED FORCES THINK ABOUT THE EIGHT BOMBS
THAT WERE DETONATED YESTERDAY AND KILLED SIX SOLDIERS AND ONE
CIVILIAN?  WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS NOW, SINCE IT IS EVIDENT THAT
EXPLOSIVES ARE AGAIN BEING USED AGAINST THE PEOPLE?

   [PONCE] WE, THE ARMED FORCES, FEEL THAT THESE EVENTS ARE CARRIED
OUT BY THE TERRORISTS WITHIN THE FMLN WHO DO NOT BELIEVE DIALOGUE IS A
MECHANISM FOR ACHIEIVING PEACE IN OUR COUNTRY.  THESE INDIVIDUALS
BELIEVE THAT VIOLENCE IS WHAT WILL LEAD THEM TO POWER.  [CONTINUED]

DEV-MUC3-1208 (SYNCHRONETICS)

   SAN SALVADOR, 3 APR 90 (RADIO CADENA YSKL) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH
COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS
OF STAFF, BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS] [EXCERPTS] [CONTINUED] [PONCE]
THEY ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF CONTEXT IN HISTORY.  THEY HAD CLEARLY
ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WOULD NOT USE CAR BOMBS FROM NOW ON, BUT THEY USED
ONE YESTERDAY NEVERTHELESS.  THIS ACTION IS CONDEMNABLE FROM EVERY
VIEWPOINT BECAUSE THE MEMBERS, RATHER THE ALUMNI, OF CETIPOL [POLICE
INSTRUCTION CENTER] WHO WERE VICTIMS OF THIS ATTACK WERE UNARMED.
THEY WERE SIMPLY DOING SOME PHYSICAL EXERCISES.  IT IS ALSO DEPLORABLE
THAT A BAKER WAS KILLED AND THAT A 12-YEAR-OLD YOUTH GOING TO SCHOOL
WAS INJURED.

   WE BELIEVE THAT THESE EVENTS DO NOT CONTRIBUTE AT ALL TO THE
CREATION OF THE APPROPRIATE ATMOSPHERE FOR SEEKING PEACE IN OUR
COUNTRY.  THIS AND MANY OTHER ACTS OF VIOLENCE WHICH HAVE RECENTLY
OCCURRED CONTRADICT THE IMAGE THAT THE FMLN HAD PREVIOUSLY TRIED TO
CREATE WITH ITS DECISION NOT TO CONTINUE SABOTAGING THE PUBLIC
TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATIONS SECTORS, AS WELL AS BUSINESSES.  ALL
THESE ACTIONS HAVE CONTINUED TO OCCUR.  WE WANT TO BELIEVE THAT THESE
ACTIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT BY TERRORISTS WHO ARE OUT OF THE FMLN
LEADERS' CONTROL, BECAUSE, AS I SAID, THIS DOES NOT HELP AT ALL TO
CREATE THE APPROPRIATE ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH TO SEEK PEACE IN OUR
COUNTRY.

   [REPORTER] COLONEL, REFERRING TO THE STATE OF SIEGE, WILL THE ARMED
FORCES INSIST ON KEEPING IT OR NOT?  THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY
PRESIDENT COMMENTED ON THIS YESTERDAY.

   [PONCE] THIS IS A POLITICAL DECISION ANYWAY, AND IT IS ADOPTED BY
THE ASSEMBLY -- SOMETIMES UPON REQUEST FROM...

   [REPORTER, INTERRUPTING] THE DEFENSE MINISTRY, YOU SAID.

   [PONCE] WE, AS AN ARMED CORPS AND WITH THE INTENTION OF HELPING
CREATE THE APPROPRIATE ATMOSPHERE FOR PEACE IN OUR COUNTRY, WILL MAKE
NO REQUEST TO EXTEND THE STATE OF EMERGENCY AND [WORDS INDISTINCT].

   [REPORTER] DOES THIS MEAN THAT THE ARMED FORCES DECIDED THIS
BECAUSE THE SITUATION OF VIOLENCE HAS DISAPPEARED?

   [PONCE] TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT CURRENT VIOLENT ACTIONS
MIGHT COME FROM GROUPS OUTSIDE THE CONTROL OF FMLN LEADERS, WE BELIEVE
THAT THE COUNTRY'S SITUATION IS NOT NORMAL ENOUGH TO SAY THAT THERE IS
NO VIOLENCE.  HOWEVER, AS A CONTRIBUTION TO THAT PROPITIOUS ATMOSPHERE
FOR THE DIALOGUE, I BELIEVE THAT IT IS ADVISABLE TO LIFT IT.

   [REPORTER] I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS: WHAT IS THE ARMED FORCES' POSITION
REGARDING [WORDS INDISTINCT]?

   [PONCE] AS FOR THE FIRST QUESTION, YOU ARE REFERRING TO STATEMENTS
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC.  I BELIEVE THAT IN DUE TIME HE WILL
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN THOSE STATEMENTS.  I UNDERSTAND THAT
THE NEWSMAN DISTORTED HIS WORDS, BUT THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF WILL HAVE
AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THE RESPECTIVE CLARIFICATION.

   I WILL, HOWEVER, STATE THAT ACCORDING TO THE REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN
ISSUED BY THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE NATIONAL POLICE AS TO WHETHER AT
ANY TIME COLONEL BENAVIDES HAS LEFT THE HANDS OF THE NATIONAL POLICE,
HE CLEARLY SAID THAT AT NO TIME HAS BENAVIDES DONE THIS.  HE IS UNDER
THE ORDERS OF THE 4TH PENAL JUDGE, AND AT NO TIME HAS THE 4TH PENAL
JUDGE AUTHORIZED COL. BENAVIDES TO LEAVE THE CONFINES OF THE JAIL.

   THE PERSON WHO MADE THE ACCUSATIONS SHOULD PRESENT SOME EVIDENCE, A
PHOTOGRAPH FOR EXAMPLE.  OTHERWISE, THIS IS ALL MERE SPECULATION.
THAT IS A VERY DELICATE CASE, AND SPECULATIONS CAST A NEGATIVE IMAGE
ON THE ARMED FORCES AND THE COUNTRY ITSELF, AND EVEN ON THE
ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN OUR COUNTRY.

   CONCERNING WHAT COULD HAPPEN IN THE TRIAL OF THE MURDER OF THE
JESUITS, THE JUSTICE AUTHORITIES WILL DETERMINE WHAT WILL BE DONE.  WE
WILL RESPECT THAT DECISION.  [CONTINUED]

DEV-MUC3-1222 (SYNCHRONETICS)

   SAN SALVADOR, 10 APR 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] COLONEL INOCENTE
MONTANO, SALVADORAN DEPUTY SECURITY MINISTER, TODAY ADMITTED THE
POSSIBILITY THAT THE SEIZURE OF AN ARMS SHIPMENT IN HONDURAS ON 7
APRIL MAY MEAN THAT THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS ARE PLANNING A NEW
MILITARY OFFENSIVE.

   ACCORDING TO MONTANO, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
(FMLN) MAY LAUNCH THE OFFENSIVE BEFORE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT- ELECT
VIOLETA CHAMORRO ASSUMES OFFICE ON 25 APRIL.

   "WE MUST NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE SALVADORAN
TERRORISTS MIGHT PROMOTE TERRORIST ACTIONS BEFORE THE SANDINISTS
RELINQUISH POWER IN ORDER TO CREATE A CLIMATE OF ANTAGONISM AGAINST
THE NEW GOVERNMENT IN MANAGUA AND DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY HAVE
STRENGTH," THE MILITARY OFFICER SAID.

   ACCORDING TO THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES, THE ARMS SHIPMENT SEIZED
BY HONDURAN AUTHORITIES ON SATURDAY CONSISTS OF 24 AK-47 RIFLES, 24
HANDLES AND 76 CLIPS FOR THOSE WEAPONS, 80 ROLLS OF "SLOW FUSE"
WEIGHING OVER 2 KG EACH, AND A "LARGE QUANTITY OF MATERIALS TO
MANUFACTURE EXPLOSIVES."

   THE MILITARY MATERIAL WAS BEING CARRIED IN A TRUCK BY SALVADORANS
VICTOR EMILIO DUBON AND FELICIANO GARCIA, WHO "WERE PART OF LOGISTICS
UNIT," OF THE FMLN, ACCORDING TO A PRESS COMMUNIQUE RELEASED BY THE
ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE (COPREFA) TODAY.

   COPREFA ADDED THAT THIS FMLN "LOGISTICS UNIT" WAS IN CHARGE OF "THE
ARMS SMUGGLING TO EL SALVADOR."

   ON 8 APRIL, ANOTHER "LARGE QUANTIITY OF MEDICINE AND SURGICAL
SUPPLIES" WAS SEIZED IN THE HONDURAN DEPARTMENT OF COPAN, WHERE THE
ARMS CARGO HAD BEEN DISCOVERED THE DAY BEFORE, COPREFA REPORTED.

   "THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES AGAIN CALL ON CITIZENS TO REPORT ALL
SORTS OF SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITIES THAT MAY BE CARRIED OUT IN THEIR
COMMUNITIES AND THUS AVERT POSSIBLE TERRORIST ACTIONS BY THE FMLN,"
COPREFA SAID IN A COMMNIQUE RELEASED TONIGHT.

   THE CHARGES REGARDING THE SEIZURE OF WEAPONS AND MEDICINE HAVE BEEN
RAISED AT A TIME WHEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN ARE PREPARING TO
RESUME THE PROCESS OF DIALOGUE UNDER UN SPONSORSHIP, PROBABLY EARLY
NEXT MONTH.

   THE DEPUTY SECURITY MINISTER NOTED THAT THE DIALOGUE PROCESS IS
"ONGOING" BUT ADDED THAT SITUATIONS LIKE THIS "HINDER THE
NEGOTIATIONS."

   MONTANO MADE THE STATEMENTS TO THE PRESS DURING THE FUNERAL OF OTTO
SORTO MILLA, SON-IN-LAW OF THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE CHIEF (GENERAL
RAFAEL VILLAMARIONA) WHO DIED YESTERDAY, 17 DAYS AFTER AN ATTACK IN
WHICH HE WAS SERIOUSLY WOUNDED AND FOR WHICH THE GUERRILLAS CLAIMED
CREDIT.

DEV-MUC3-1229 (BOEING)

   BOGOTA, 23 APR 90 (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [TEXT] INVESTIGATIONS UNDER
WAY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY HAVE BEEN FRUITLESS REGARDING THE ALLEGED
PRESENCE OF SPANISH, BRITISH, ISRAELI, OR ITALIAN TERRORISTS IN COLOMBIA,
FOLLOWING THE FOILED ATTACK ON SEVEN GENERALS, EIGHT COLONELS, AND OTHER TOP
COMMANDERS OF THE ARMY AND NATIONAL POLICE IN MEDELLIN.

   MEANWHILE, GENERAL MIGUEL ALFREDO MAZA MARQUEZ, DIRECTOR OF THE
ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY, IDENTIFIED EUGENIO EXENDESTE,
AN IDEOLOGIST OF THE BASQUE FATHERLAND AND LIBERTY [ETA] SEPARATIST
ORGANIZATION, AS THE LINK BETWEEN THE MEDELLIN CARTEL AND THE SPANISH
TERRORISTS.

   POLICE OPERATIONS DIRECTOR GENERAL OCTAVIO VARGAS SILVA SAID THAT
ALL SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS ARE ON MAXIMUM ALERT.  HE NOTED THAT THE
SECRET ORGANIZATIONS HAVE COMPOSITE SKETCHES OF THE SUSPECTED ETA
MEMBERS AND THE TWO COLOMBIANS WHO COORDINATED ALL THE STEPS TO CARRY
OUT THE ATTACK THAT WAS INTENDED TO KILL MANY CIVILIANS AS A RESULT OF
A ROCKET ATTACK ON A GASOLINE TRUCK THAT CARRIED 3,000 GALLONS OF
FLIGHT FUEL.

DEV-MUC3-1231 (BOEING)

   SAN SALVADOR, 25 APR 90 (CANAL DOCE) -- [COMMUNIQUE] [COLONEL
SIGIFREDO OCHOA PEREZ] [TEXT] 1. THE ATTITUDE OF CERTAIN BAD ARMED
FORCES MEMBERS SHOULD NOT BE USED TO CREATE A NEGATIVE IMAGE OF THE
ARMED FORCES IN GENERAL.  QUITE THE CONTRARY, IT IS APPROPRIATE TO
PURGE THE RANKS AND GET RID OF THOSE BAD MEMBERS, SO THAT THEY DO NOT
CONTINUE TO HARM THE REMAINING MEMBERS.

   2.  THIS PUBLIC STATEMENT ABOUT THE NEED FOR A PURGE IS SIMPLY THE
REPLY TO A HISTORICAL REQUIREMENT, BECAUSE WHOEVER REPORTS THE ISSUE
DOES NOT CAUSE THE DAMAGE.

   3. IN REFERENCE TO THOSE WHO CARRIED OUT THE ORDER TO ASSASSINATE
THE JESUITS, THEY WERE ACTUALLY DOING THAT -- CARRYING OUT ORDERS.  I
HAVE ONLY SAID IN PUBLIC WHAT THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING AND
EXPRESSING IN A LOW VOICE.

   4.  THEREFORE, A NATIONAL COMMENTARY DOES NOT ENDANGER THE COUNTRY
OR THE ARMED FORCES.  THOSE WHO DECIDED TO ADOPT A DECISION, WHOSE
SUBSEQUENT CONSEQUENCES THEY SHOULD HAVE ASSESSED, ARE THE ONES WHO
ENDANGERED THE U.S. MILITARY AID AND -- IN THE PROCESS -- WITTINGLY OR
UNWITTINGLY PLAYED INTO THE FMLN'S [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT] HANDS.

   5.  WE SUPPOSE THAT THERE IS INFORMATION ON THE ISSUE AND THAT IT
IS EXCLUSIVELY IN THE HANDS OF CERTAIN GROUPS WHICH, FOR ONE REASON OR
ANOTHER, HAVE FAILED TO TURN IT OVER TO THE APPROPRIATE PERSONS.

   6.  JUST AS THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND A VAST MAJORITY OF
THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE EXPECTED, A FULL INVESTIGATION AND SOLUTION OF
THIS CRIME WHICH SHOOK THE WORLD, ALL GOOD SALVADORANS TRUST THAT
JUSTICE WILL PREVAIL AND THAT THOSE WHO VIOLATED THE LAW WILL ANSWER
FOR THE CRIME THEY HAVE PERPETRATED.

SET ASIDE THEIR STRUGGLE AGAINST EXTRADITION.  THEY ARE NOW DEMANDING
POLITICAL - MILITARY TREATMENT AND HAVE THREATENED TO CONTINUE WITH
THIS TYPE OF ACTION.  THEY WARN THAT THEY HAVE WHAT THEY HAVE CALLED
AN IRANIAN-MADE Z-5 K, WHICH ACCORDING TO ZAPATOCA WILL BE USED FOR
THE FIRST TIME IN BOGOTA WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

DEV-MUC3-1235 (BOEING)

   BOGOTA, 26 APR 90 (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [TEXT] A FEW MINUTES AGO AN
OFFICIAL SPOKESMAN FROM THE NATIONAL SOCIAL SECURITY FUND [CNPS] READ THE
FOLLOWING COMMUNIQUE CONFIRMING THE DEATH OF MR. PIZARRO.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [UNIDENTIFIED SPOKESMAN] THE CNPS REGRETS TO INFORM
THE PEOPLE THAT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE CARLOS PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ WAS
ADMITTED TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM THIS MORNING, AFTER HAVING BEEN SHOT
SEVERAL TIMES IN THE HEAD AND NECK A FEW MINUTES EARLIER.  THESE SHOTS
CAUSED VERY SERIOUS NEUROLOGICAL AND CEREBRAL WOUNDS AS WELL AS GRAVE
WOUNDS TO THE FACE AND NECK.

   DESPITE THE EFFORTS OF A TEAM OF DOCTORS, INCLUDING GENERAL
SURGEONS, NEUROSURGEONS, ANESTHESISTS, OPHTHALMOLOGISTS, DOCTORS FROM
THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT, AND OTHER STAFF MEMBERS OF THE CNPS, IT WAS
NOT POSSIBLE TO SAVE HIS LIFE AND HE DIED [7-SECOND BREAK IN
RECEPTION] [END RECORDING]

   ...GOT INTO AN ALTERCATION WITH THE M-19 LEADERS WHO WERE THERE AT
THE TIME SHOUTING SLOGANS.  THEY DID NOT ALLOW THE CNPS SPOKESMAN TO
FINISH READING THE COMMUNIQUE.

   THE AUTHORITIES HAVE AGAIN CORDONED OFF THE AREA.  THE M-19 MEMBERS
ARE PROTESTING THE MURDER OF PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ [7-SECOND BREAK IN
RECEPTION] I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION THAT THE NATIONAL POLICE, THE F-2,
AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTAMENT OF SECURITY ARE CURRENTLY LOOKING
FOR AT LEAST TWO COLLABORATORS OF THE PAID ASSASSIN WHO MURDERED M-19
LEADER PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ.

   THE AUTHORITIES HAVE REPORTED THAT AT LEAST TWO MEN COLLABORATED
WITH THE MURDERER INSIDE THE HK-1400 PLANE THAT WAS FLYING BETWEEN
BOGOTA AND BARRANQUILLA.  THE AUTHORITIES HAVE ALSO REPORTED THAT THE
MACHINEGUN USED BY THE PAID ASSASSIN, WHO IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS ALVARO
RODRIGUEZ, WAS HIDDEN IN THE BATHROOM.  NOW THE AUTHORITIES ARE TRYING
TO ESTABLISH IF THE WEAPON WAS PLACED THERE AT THE BUCARAMANGA
AIRPORT, WHERE THE PLANE HAD BEEN FOR THE PAST FEW HOURS, OR IF IT WAS
PLACED THERE IN BOGOTA.

   THE POLICE HAD SEARCHED THE PAID ASSASSIN TWICE BEFORE THE INCIDENT
BUT DID NOT FIND ANY WEAPONS.

DEV-MUC3-1237 (BOEING)

   BOGOTA, 26 APR 90 (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [TEXT] GOVERNMENT MINISTER
HORACIO SERPA URIBE, WHO HAS JUST LEFT THE NATIONAL SOCIAL WELFARE
INSTITUTE, HAS DENOUNCED CARLOS PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ' ASSASSINATION.  HE ADDED
THAT NO THOUGHT HAS BEEN GIVEN TO SUSPENDING THE ELECTIONS IN THE WAKE OF
THIS DEVELOPMENT, AND ADDED THAT THE COUNTRY MUST NOT BE LEFT IN VIOLENT
HANDS.

   THE GOVERNMENT MINISTER COMMENTED FURTHER ON THE TOP M-19 [19 APRIL
MOVEMENT] LEADER'S ASSASSINATION:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [SERPA] THE OCCURRENCE OF SUCH SAD AND CRIMINAL
DEVELOPMENTS IS TRULY A DISGRACE.  IT HAS SADDENED EVERYBODY VERY
MUCH.  I FEEL THAT THIS WAS NOT ONLY AN ATTACK AGAINST FORMER
CANDIDATE PIZARRO BUT AN ATTACK AGAINST THE COUNTRY, DEMOCRACY, AND
THE ELECTORAL PROCESS.  I FEEL THAT WE MUST RESPOND TO AGGRESSIVENESS
AND CRIME WITH FEELINGS OF CONCILIATION AND PEACE.

   [REPORTER] HAS ANY THOUGHT BEEN GIVEN TO SUSPENDING THE ELECTIONS
AFTER THIS ASSASSINATION, BEARING IN MIND THAT PIZARRO WAS ONE OF THE
MOST IMPORTANT CANDIDATES?

   [SEPRPA] HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CANDIDATES.
THE GOVERNMENT ALWAYS THOUGHT SO.  IN ADDITION, THE GOVERNMENT HIGHLY
REGARDS THE PEACEMKING PROCESS IT HAS BEEN CARRYING OUT WITH THE M-19,
IN WHICH PIZARRO WAS UNDOUBTEDLY A KEY PLAYER.  WE HAVE ADOPTED SOME
DECISIONS IN THIS REGARD.  I AM GOING TO MEET WITH THE HEAD OF STATE
AND ALL OF US WILL BE CLOSELY WATCHING THE SAD DEVELOPMENTS WHICH
COLOMBIA IS EXPERIENCING WITH A DESIRE TO MEET THE NEED FOR
TRANQUILLITY AND COEXISTENCE WHICH, UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAVE NOT HAD
THUS FAR.

   [REPORTER] MR. MINISTER, WHAT DOES THE FACT THAT TWO PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATES HAVE BEEN ASSASSINATED IN LESS THAN 40 DAYS REPRESENT TO
THE GOVERNMENT?  HOW DOES THE GOVERNMENT LOOK BEFORE THE NATION AND
THE WORLD?

   [SERPA] WELL, I REPEAT, THIS IS A VERY SAD CIRCUMSTANCE.  THIS IS
EXTREMELY WORRISOME, OF COURSE.  LIKE ALL COLOMBIANS, WE ARE TROUBLED
OVER THE FACT THAT WE ARE CONSTANTLY BEING FLOODED WITH CRIME AND
BLOODSHED.  THE GOVERNMENT IS DOING THE IMPOSSIBLE TO PROTECT ALL
CITIZENS AND TO GUARANTEE THE ELECTIONS AND THE NORMAL DEVELOPMENT OF
COLOMBIANS' LIVES.  HOWEVER, THERE ARE DELUDED MINDS AND THERE ARE
CRIMINALS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN DAMAGING THE COUNTRY.  THIS IS AN
ATTACK AGAINST COLOMBIA, AGAINST THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE.

   [REPORTER] MR. MINISTER, HAVE YOU AT ANY TIME THOUGHT OF ADOPTING
SPECIAL MEASURES?  WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THE PUBLIC ORDER SITUATION IN
COLOMBIA AT THIS TIME?  WHAT REPORTS DO YOU HAVE?

   [SERPA] NO, THERE IS CALM IN GENERAL. THE GOVERNMENT IS VERY
WORRIED, OF COURSE.  WE ARE GOING TO MEET NOW TO DISCUSS THIS TERRIBLE
CASE.

   [REPORTER] HOWEVER, DO YOU NOT THINK THAT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO
GO ON CAMPAIGNING IN PUBLIC AT THIS MOMENT?

   [SERPA] I WOULD NOT DARE MAKE ANY ASSERTION IN THIS REGARD. WHAT I
FEEL IS THAT WE MUST NOT YIELD A SINGLE CENTIMETER TO THE VIOLENT
PEOPLE AND THE CRIMINALS.  [END RECORDING]

   SERPA MADE THESE STATEMENTS A FEW MINUTES AGO AS HE LEFT THE
NATIONAL SOCIAL WELFARE INSTITUTE, WHERE AN AUTOPSY IS BEING PERFORMED
AT THIS MOMENT ON PIZARRO'S BODY.

DEV-MUC3-1240 (BOEING)

   SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY MODERATOR AND REPORTERS] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] [MODERATOR] ROLANDO GONZALEZ, LOS ANGELES TIMES.

   [GONZALEZ] MR. PRESIDENT, I WANT TO MAKE A QUESTION THAT WAS MADE IN
SPANISH BEFORE AND IT'S RELATED ABOUT COLONEL OCHOA PEREZ.  HE HAS BEEN A
HARD-LINE MILITARY AND DON'T YOU THINK THAT HIS [WORDS INDISTINCT] GOT TO BE
POSSIBLE?  THIS IS ONE AND I GOT A SECOND ONE.  CAN YOU TELL US IN ENGLISH
WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE RELATION WITH THE NEW NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT AND WHAT
DO YOU KNOW ABOUT RECENT MACHINEGUN TRAFFIC OF THE GUERRILLAS?

   [CRISTIANI] WELL, WITH THE FIRST CASE MY OPINION IS THAT ANYBODY THAT HAS
ANY INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS
SHOULD -- INSTEAD OF SPECULATE WITH IT PUBLICLY -- SHOULD GO STRAIGHT TO THE
COURT THAT IS IN CHARGE OF THE CASE AND GIVE ALL THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE
TO HIM OR THAT HE IS KNOWLEDGEABLE OF, AND THEN HAVE THE JUDGE DO SOMETHING
ABOUT IT.

   I THINK THAT MERE SPECULATION IN PUBLIC IS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT
GOOD FOR THE JUDICIAL PROCESS BECAUSE IT CREATES PROBLEMS FOR IT.
SECONDLY, EVEN THOUGH HE WAS A HIGH-RANKING OFFICER, IN CASES LIKE
THIS, IT IS NOT NECESSARILY THE OPINION OF A SPECIFIC MEMBER OF THE
ARMED FORCES IS ONE WHICH IS TOTALLY TRUE OR TOTALLY FALSE [SENTENCE
AS HEARD].  YOU CANNOT SIMPLY GO BY THAT AS A WAY TO SIMPLY STATE THAT
HIS STATEMENTS ARE TRUE.

   IT IS VERY INTERESTING TO SEE THAT WHEREAS BEFORE NO ONE REALLY
WOULD BELIEVE COL. OCHOA, ALL OF A SUDDEN EVERYONE WANTS TO GIVE HIM
ALL THE CREDIBILITY IN THIS CASE.  I AM NOT SAYING THAT WHAT HE SAID
IS TRUE OR UNTRUE.  MY POINT IS THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE DEBATED
PUBLICLY; THAT ANYBODY -- COL. OCHOA, MEMBERS OF THE JESUIT COMMUNITY,
OR ANYBODY ELSE -- WHO HAS ANY INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE TRIAL
SHOULD GO TO THE JUDGE AND GIVE HIM THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE THAT
WOULD BE HELPING THE PROCESS AND NOT MERE SPECULATIONS IN PUBLIC.

   WITH RESPECT TO THE RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA, WE DISCUSSED THIS
WITH ONE OF THE ADVISERS OF MRS. CHAMORRO DURING OUR VISIT AND WE
DECIDED TO INITIATE [32-SECOND BREAK IN TRANSMISSION] PLANS AND,
THEREFORE, WE ARE WILLING TO REINITIATE THE PROCESS.  HER ADVISER WAS
VERY CLEAR TO STATE THAT THEY WILL BY NO MEANS AID THE FMLN IN THAT
RESPECT.

   WE THINK THAT WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING BETWEEN THE 25TH OF FEBRUARY
AND THE 25TH OF APRIL IS THAT THE FMLN THOUGHT THAT IT WAS TIME TO GET
ALL THAT WAS LEFT IN NICARAGUA....[CORRECTS HIMSELF) OUT OF NICARAGUA
BECAUSE THEY KNEW OF THE PROBLEMS THEY WOULD FACE WITH THE NEW
GOVERNMENT, AND THAT THEY COULD NO LONGER GO ABOUT FREELY IN NICARAGUA
WITH THEIR WEAPONS AND THEIR LOGISTIC SUPPORT.  THEREFORE, THEY HAVE
BEEN TRYING TO BRING THEM IN.  IN THAT CASE THERE WAS A GROUP OF FMLN
MEMBERS WHO WERE DETAINED IN HONDURAS WITH THE HELP OF THE HONDURAN
AUTHORITIES, AND IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THEY HAD BEEN SHIPPING WEAPONS BY
LAND THROUGH HONDURAN TERRITORY, BUT THAT GROUP WAS DETAINED.

   [MODERATOR, IN SPANISH] THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT; THANK YOU, MR.
FOREIGN MINISTER.  JOURNALISTS, THANK YOU.

DEV-MUC3-1241 (BOEING)

   BOGOTA, 26 APR 90 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [SPEECH]
[GOVERNMENT MINISTER HORACIO SERPA URIBE] [TEXT] GOOD EVENING.  WE
COLOMBIANS HAD NOT GOTTEN OVER YESTERDAY'S CRUEL ATTACK IN MEDELLIN
WHEN WE WERE CONFRONTED WITH ANOTHER DISGRACE THAT TOOK THE LIFE OF
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE CARLOS PIZARRO.  IN A MESSAGE FROM THE
PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC, THE GOVERNMENT VOICED ITS DEEP ANGER AND
SADNESS OVER THIS CRIMINAL ATTACK AND IT RATIFIED ITS DETERMINATION TO
CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITHOUT DISMAY AGAINST ALL FORMS OF CRIMES AND
THE CRIMINALS WHO ARE SO INFAMOUSLY ATTACKING PEACE AND DEMOCRACY.

   THIS IS NO TIME TO ABANDON ANY ATTITUDE THAT IS DEEMED ADVISABLE
FOR THE NATION.  IN THE FACE OF THE FRATRICIDAL AND ANTI-PATRIOTIC
VIOLENCE, WE MUST ANSWER WITH ACTIONS OF UNDERSTANDING AND
CONCILIATION, WITH DECISIONS THAT WILL DISMANTLE THE BANDS OF
CRIMINALS WHO ARE DOING SUCH SERIOUS HARM TO THE PEOPLE AND WITH THE
DETERMINATION THAT WILL RENEW FAITH IN DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES AND IN
THE PURPOSE TO ACHIEVE THE BEST LEVELS OF COEXISTENCE.  THE GOVERNMENT
IS DETERMINED TO DO THAT.

   HOWEVER, THIS RESPONSIBILITY LIES WITH ALL COLOMBIANS OF GOODWILL.
FROM EACH OF OUR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN, WE DEMAND POSITIVE ACTIONS AND A
GREAT SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF
SAFEGUARDING THE CITIZENS' SECURITY THROUGHOUT THE NATION.  THE PEACE,
UNDERSTANDING, AND CONCILIATION TO WHICH CARLOS PIZARRO WAS COMMITTED
SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE THE BASIC GOALS OF THE COUNTRY AND OF ITS
CITIZENS.

   ALL THE NECESSARY MEASURES THAT WILL LEAD TO CLARIFYING THAT
TREACHEROUS CRIME ARE BEING TAKEN TO DETERMINE WHO IS RESPONSIBLE AND
THEN PUNISH THEM.  TO THIS EFFECT, THE GOVERNMENT'S ACTION WILL BE
VERY SEVERE, AND THE INVESTIGATING AUTHORITIES ARE ALREADY BEING
PROVIDED VERY AMPLE COOPERATION.

   THE GOVERNMENT MAINTAINS DIRECT COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE 19 APRIL
MOVEMENT [M-19] LEADERS, AND IT HAS BEEN ATTENTIVE TO ITS DEMANDS,
CHARGES, AND CONCERNS.  THERE IS A MARKED INTEREST BECAUSE THERE
CONTINUES TO BE DIRECT RELATIONS WITH ALL POLITICAL PARTIES, THE
VARIOUS POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ASSOCIATIONS, AND THE PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATES CONCERNING THE IMPLEMENTATION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF SECURITY
AND INDISPENSABLE GUARANTEES SO THAT WE WILL HOLD THE ELECTIONS ON 27
MAY, AS THE PEOPLE WANT.

   NATIONAL COEXISTENCE, TOGETHER WITH THE CITIZENS' DEMANDS FOR
REFORMS, WILL CONTINUE TO BE A BASIC GOAL OF THE GOVERNMENT OF DR.
VIRGILIO BARCO, WHO WILL TOMORROW ADDRESS THE COLOMBIANS.  M-19 HAS
ASKED THE GOVERNMENT TO ALLOW IT TO MAKE PUBLIC ITS FEELINGS AND
OPINIONS IN THE FACE OF THIS GREAT TRAGEDY.

   THROUGH ME, AND ACCORDING TO THE PROVISIONS OF LAW 42 OF 1985, THE
GOVERNMENT HAS REQUESTED THIS AIR TIME SO THAT ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF,
SPOKESMAN OF THE POLITICAL PARTY WHOSE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WAS
BRUTALLY MURDERED TODAY, WILL BE ABLE TO FREELY EXPRESS HIS IDEAS.

   THOSE WHO SEEK TO EXCLUDE FROM THE ELECTORAL PROCESS A POLITICAL
PARTY -- REGARDLESS OF WHICH ONE IT MAY BE -- WILL NOT ACHIEVE IT,
BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT WILL GUARANTEE THAT ITS VOICE WILL CONTINUE TO
BE HEARD.  DESPITE OF THE DIFFICULTIES, COLOMBIAN DEMOCRACY WILL WIN.

DEV-MUC3-1242 (BOEING)

   BOGOTA, 24 APR 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE LEFTIST PATRIOTIC UNION (UP)
TODAY ASKED COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO TO BE ADMITTED TO THE
NEGOTIATIONS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS HOLDING WITH DIVERSE POLITICAL
GROUPS TO REACH AN AGREEMENT THAT WILL PERMIT THE INTRODUCTION OF
NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS.

   THE UP NATIONAL DIRECTORATE MET TODAY WITH BARCO AND GAVE HIM A
LETTER NOTING THAT THE EXCLUSION OF SOCIAL FORCES IN THE NEGOTIATIONS
MAY AGAIN BE A MOCKERY OF THE PEOPLE.  IT AGAIN ASKED FOR PROTECTION
FOR THE LIVES OF ITS MILITANTS.

   SINCE IT WAS FOUNDED IN 1985, MORE THAN 1,000 UP MEMBERS HAVE BEEN
KILLED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.

   THE UP EXPLAINS IN ITS LETTER THAT THE ASSASSINATION ON 22 MARCH OF
BERNARDO JARAMILLO, ITS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, FORCED IT TO WITHDRAW
FROM THE 27 MAY ELECTIONS.  THIS DID NOT DETER IT, HOWEVER, FROM ITS
STRUGGLE FOR A PLEBISCITE AND FROM CALLING FOR A NATIONAL, POPULAR AND
DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY.

   THE UP ADDED THAT A CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY, WHICH WILL REPRESENT ALL
POPULAR SECTORS, WILL BE CHARGED WITH DRAFTING CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS.
THE REFORMS MUST THEN BE SUBMITTED TO A PLEBISCITE.

   A WEEK AGO, THE LIBERAL PARTY, SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE PARTY, 19 APRIL
MOVEMENT (M-19), AND NATIONAL SALVATION MOVEMENT MET TO TRY TO REACH
AN AGREEMENT THAT WILL PERMIT HOLDING A NATIONAL PLEBISCITE ON 27 MAY
TO APPROVE SUBSTANTIAL REFORMS TO THE STATE.

   GOVERNMENT MINISTER HORACIO SERPA URIBE STATED THAT THE
ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT AND DOES NOT SEEK TO IMPOSE ITS CRITERIA ON THE
WILL TO EFFECT CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM.  HE ADDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S
POSITION IS VERY CLEAR AND SEEKS TO RESPOND TO THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE.

   ALSO, THE UP CONVENED POLITICAL PARTIES, SOCIAL FORCES, STUDENTS,
AND COLOMBIANS IN GENERAL WHO WERE EXCLUDED FROM THESE NEGOTIATIONS,
TO UNITE A PROPOSAL ON THE 27 MAY PLEBISCITE.

   FINALLY, THE UP DIRECTORATE ASKED, AS A CONTRIBUTION TO PEACE IN
THE COUNTRY, TO BE ABLE TO MEET WITH THE REBEL FORCES.

DEV-MUC3-1245 (BOEING)

   BOGOTA, 27 APR 90 [INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [SPEECH]
[COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO] [TEXT] FELLOW COUNTRYMEN: THE
MURDER OF CARLOS PIZARRO SOUGHT BOTH TO DISRUPT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE
ELECTORAL PROCESS, AS WELL AS TO DESTROY THE PROCESS OF RECONCILIATION
THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND M- 19 [19 APRIL MOVEMENT] HAD CAREFULLY BUILT,
SURPASSING NUMEROUS OBSTACLES.  IT ALSO SEEKS TO WEAKEN THE STATE AND
MAKE COLOMBIANS LOSE FAITH IN DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS.  HOWEVER, THOSE
WHO FOMENT VIOLENCE WILL NOT MANAGE TO WEAKEN A STRONG DEMOCRACY THAT
IS SUPPORTED BY ALL COLOMBIANS OR TO DESTROY THE PATH OF PEACE THAT WE
HAVE BUILT AFTER SO MANY DIFFICULTIES.

   TWO OF THESE DIFFICULTIES STEM BACK MORE THAN FIVE DECADES.  THE
FIRST DIFFICULTY WAS TO BUILD AN ATMOSPHERE OF PEACE IN A COUNTRY
WHERE THE VIOLENCE WE HAVE INHERITED FLARED UP IN THE FIFTIES, AND
AFTER HAVING EVOLVED, IT HAS TAKEN ON DIFFERENT FORMS, SUCH AS
NARCO-TERRORISM AND BANDS OF HIRED ASSASSINS ENCOURAGED BY GROUPS OF
THE EXTREME RIGHT.

   THE SECOND OBSTACLE, ALONG WITH THE PREVIOUS ONE, IS THE LACK OF
TOLERANCE FOR POLITICAL PLURALISM.  EVEN PROGRESSIVE IDEAS ARE MANY
TIMES CONSIDERED DANGEROUS BY PEOPLE WHO DO NOT REALIZE THAT THE COLD
WAR IS OVER.  A PLURALIST DEMOCRACY IS NOT AFRAID OF COMMUNISM.  ON
THE CONTRARY, IT ACCEPTS COMMUNISM, BUT IT DOES NOT ACCEPT VIOLENCE,
REGARDLESS OF ITS SOURCE.  THE USE OF WEAPONS BOTH TO DEFEND AN
IDEOLOGY, AS WELL AS TO FIGHT AGAINST IT, IS UNACCEPTABLE IN A
PLURALIST DEMOCRACY.

   THE PERSONS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TRAGIC MURDER OF CARLOS PIZARRO
WILL NOT MANAGE TO DESTROY WHAT HAS BEEN BEEN ACHIEVED, THAT IS, A
CLEAR, VIABLE, AND DEFINED PATH TO PEACE.  THE OBLIGATION WE HAVE
AHEAD OF US AND THAT WE WILL CARRY OUT UNITED IS TO KEEP THAT PATH OF
PEACE OPEN.

   ALL COLOMBIANS ADMIRE THE PEACE INITIATIVES OF THE M-19, AND WE
SHARE THE GRIEF OF THE RELATIVES AND FOLLOWERS OF CARLOS PIZARRO,
BECAUSE THEIR SADNESS AND ANGER IS SHARED BY ALL COLOMBIANS WHO LOVE
PEACE.  FACTS SHOW THAT THE M-19 MEMBERS WISELY ADOPTED THE DECISION
TO REJOIN DEMOCRACY AND REMAIN IN DEMOCRACY, TO STRUGGLE FOR PEACE,
AND TO PROMOTE LEGALLY THE REFORMS THEY CONSIDER NECESSARY.

   WHEN THEY ABANDONED THEIR WEAPONS, THEY DID NOT ABANDON THE
STRUGGLE FOR THEIR IDEALS.  THEY HAVE ALL THEIR RIGHTS, BECAUSE THEY
ARE NO LONGER A GUERRILLA GROUP.  M-19 IS NOW A POLITICAL PARTY, WITH
ALL RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF A POLITICAL PARTY AND WHOSE IDEAS SHOULD BE
TOLERATED.  THOSE WHO, THROUGH VIOLENCE, ARE TRYING TO BRING DOWN THE
M-19 FLAG AND TO PREVENT ITS CANDIDATES FROM RUNNING IN THE ELECTIONS
AND TO STOP THEM FROM CONDUCTING POLITICAL CAMPAIGNING, ARE NOT JUST
THE ENEMIES OF THAT MOVEMENT, THEY ARE THE ENEMIES OF PEACE.  THEY ARE
TRYING TO DESTROY THE PATH THAT WAS BUILT FOR THE REINCORPORATION OF
THE GUERRILLA GROUPS INTO CIVILIAN LIFE.

   THE MATERIAL AND INTELLECTUAL AUTHORS OF CARLOS PIZARRO'S MURDER
ARE THE ENEMIES OF DEMOCRACY, BECAUSE THEY HOPE TO SABOTAGE THE
ELECTIONS AND PREVENT NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR POLITICAL PARTICIPATION.
THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT ALLOW THE VOICE OF M-19 TO BE SILENCED.
THEREFORE, THE GOVERNMENT YESTERDAY REQUESTED AIRTIME ON TELEVISION SO
THAT ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF, LEADER OF THAT PARTY, COULD EXPRESS HIS
OPINIONS TO ALL COLOMBIANS.  [CONTINUED]

DEV-MUC3-1246 (BOEING)

   BOGOTA, 27 APR 90 [INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [SPEECH]
[COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] WHEN THE
CONVERGENCE OF OPINIONS ON THE FUNDAMENTAL ASPECTS OF THE CREATION OF
A CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY IS MADE PUBLIC, THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTRIBUTE
TOWARD THE COUNTING OF THE RELEVANT BALLOT PAPERS.

   THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES IT IS NECESSARY TO REDUCE AS MUCH AS
POSSIBLE THE RISK FOR EACH OF THE CANDIDATES.  DESPITE THE STRICT
SECURITY MEASURES TAKEN BY CARLOS PIZARRO, THE SUICIDAL CALLING OF A
HIRED ASSASSIN AT THE SERVICE OF EVIL INTERESTS ENDED HIS LIFE.

   IN VIEW OF THESE TOTALLY IRRATIONAL METHODS, LARGE NUMBERS OF
BODYGUARDS, BULLETPROOF VESTS, AND PRACTICAL SECURITY MEASURES COULD
HELP, BUT THEY ARE NOT ENOUGH.

   IT IS NECESSARY FOR AUTHORITIES AND CAMPAIGN OFFICIALS TO TAKE
MAXIMUM PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES.  THERE MUST BE MORE MODERN AND DIRECT
COMMUNICATION WITH THE PEOPLE.

   I ADMIRE THE COURAGE OF THE CANDIDATES WHO HAVE GONE TO PUBLIC
SQUARES, BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT THE HEALTH OF DEMOCRACY AND THE
STABILITY OF INSTITUTIONS DEPENDS ON THE LIVES OF THE CANDIDATES.

   SO THIS CAMPAIGN CAN TAKE PLACE UNDER THE BEST OF CONDITIONS
WITHOUT THE NEED FOR CANDIDATES TO RUN THE RISKS INVOLVED IN
TRADITIONAL FORMS OF PROSELYTISM, THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO
INCREASE TELEVISION TIME FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES OF THE
PARTIES AND MOVEMENTS THAT ARE REPRESENTED IN CONGRESS, ON BOTH
NATIONAL AND REGIONAL CHANNELS.

   IN ADDITION, THE GOVERNMENT WILL ALLOW THE FREE USE OF RADIO
STATIONS FOR THE SAME PURPOSE AND WILL GIVE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR
ADVERTISEMENTS.  WE ARE TRYING FOR A MORE MODERN CAMPAIGN IN WHICH NEW
TECHNIQUES CAN BE USED TO EXPLAIN THE PROGRAMS OF THE CANDIDATES SO
THAT THEY CAN DIRECTLY MAKE CONTACT WITH CITIZENS AND THEIR FAMILIES
IN THEIR OWN HOMES.

   BESIDES, THE GOVERNMENT WILL INTENSIFY ITS CIVIC CAMPAIGN BY
INVITING ALL CITIZENS TO VOTE IN THE NEXT ELECTIONS.  THEIR VOTE FOR
ANY OF THE CANDIDATES OR EVEN A BLANK VOTE IS AN EXPRESSION OF THE
PEOPLE'S REJECTION OF VIOLENCE.  IT IS A WAY OF RESOLVING CONFLICTS BY
PEACEFUL AND DEMOCRATIC MEANS.

   TO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN THE NEXT ELECTIONS IS TO VOTE FOR PEACE,
FOR DEMOCRACY AND TOLERANCE.  AMID THE SITUATION IN WHICH THIS COUNTRY
IS LIVING, VOTING IS AN OBLIGATION.  NO CITIZEN WITH A RIGHT TO VOTE
CAN AFFORD TO REMAIN AT HOME AND REMAIN INDIFFERENT.  [CONTINUED]

DEV-MUC3-1249 (BOEING)

   BOGOTA, 29 APR 90 (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [TEXT] FOLLOWING THE FUNERAL
OF M-19 [19 APRIL MOVEMENT] PRESIDENT CARLOS PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ, THE GROUP'S
NEW PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF SAID THAT HIS GROUP WILL
CONTINUE THE STRUGGLE FOR PEACE.  THE M-19, THE ORGANIZATION THAT SIGNED A
PEACE AGREEMENT WITH PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S GOVERNMENT ON 8 MARCH AND
LAID DOWN ITS WEAPONS ON 9 MARCH TO BECOME A POLITICAL PARTY, SAID THAT IT
WILL NOT PICK UP ITS WEAPONS AGAIN AS A RESULT OF THE MURDER OF THE
39-YEAR-OLD PIZARRO.  PIZARRO WAS BURIED YESTERDAY.  ONLY 50 DAYS AFTER
REJOINING CIVILIAN LIFE FOLLOWING MORE THAN 20 YEARS OF ARMED STRUGGLE,
PIZARRO BECAME A SYMBOL FOR PEACE, ALTHOUGH, ACCORDING TO COMMENTATORS, WITH
HIS DEATH HIS KILLERS ARE ATTEMPTING TO DESTABILIZE THE COUNTRY.

   WHEN ACCEPTING THE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION, ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF,
A 42-YEAR-OLD ENGINEER, FORMER DEAN OF A UNIVERSITY, REBEL, AND THE
OLDEST OF SEVEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS, SAID THAT HE WAS RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT FOR THAT COLOMBIA WHICH WANTS DEMOCRACY AND WISHES TO LIVE
IN PEACE.  THE NEW M-19 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WAS FORCED TO SPEAK AND
ACCEPT THE NOMINATION WHEN PIZARRO'S FUNERAL PROCESSION MADE A STOP AT
THE HOME OF THE LIBERATOR SIMON BOLIVAR.  HE SAID THAT THE COLOMBIAN
PEOPLE MUST UNITE TO MAKE HARMONY POSSIBLE, AND HE URGED EVERYONE TO
CONTRIBUTE TO A FUTURE OF PEACE, A BETTER FUTURE FOR COMING
GENERATIONS.  SPEAKING BEFORE PIZARRO'S CASKET, WHICH WAS DRAPED WITH
THE COLOMBIAN FLAG, NAVARRO, WHO IN 1985 SURVIVED AN ATTACK DURING
WHICH HE LOST A LEG, SWORE TO FIGHT FOR PEACE AS PIZARRO HAD DONE.

   THE THOUSANDS OF PERSONS WHO ATTENDED SATURDAY'S FUNERAL CARRIED
PLACARDS WITH SLOGANS THAT READ: COMMANDER PIZARRO, WE CONTINUE
FORWARD, AND COMRADE PIZARRO, WE ARE FOR PEACE, WE SWEAR.  OTHERS WHO
JOINED THE THOUSANDS OF VOICES ASKING NAVARRO TO ACCEPT THE
PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION BROKE THE SILENCE ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS TO
CHANT: PIZARRO PRESENT, NAVARRO PRESIDENT.

   PIZARRO'S MOTHER MARGOT DE PIZARRO, ALONG WITH HIS LADY FRIEND
LAURA, SPOKE AT THE GRAVE SITE AND ASKED THE CROWD TO FIGHT FOR PEACE
AS HE HAD ALWAYS DONE.

   AT THE CEMETERY THE NEW PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AGAIN ADDRESSED THE
CROWD, WHO HAD FOLLOWED THE MORE THAN SEVEN-HOUR-LONG FUNERAL
PROCESSION FROM THE CATHEDRAL TO SIMON BOLIVAR'S HOME AND THEN TO THE
CEMETERY.  HE SAID: TOGETHER WITH ALL THE GOOD COLOMBIANS, WE ARE
GOING TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF HISTORY.  HE ADDED THAT PIZARRO'S MURDER
WAS USELESS BECAUSE THE M-19 WILL CONTINUE ITS STRUGGLE FOR PEACE.

   PIZARRO'S FUNERAL WAS HELD IN BOGOTA.  THE AUTHORITIES PRAISED THE
FACT THAT NO INCIDENTS OR PUBLIC DISORDERS DEVELOPED DURING THE
FUNERAL.  THE M-19 LEADERS HAD ASKED THE PEOPLE TO REMAIN CALM.

   THE NEW COLOMBIAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IS THE SIXTH COMMANDER
M-19 HAS HAD, THE SECOND SINCE THE REBEL GROUP ENTERED ITS NEW PHASE
TO BECOME A POLITICAL PARTY.  ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF WILL BE RUNNING
AGAINST 12 OTHER CANDIDATES IN THE ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR 27 MAY.

DEV-MUC3-1253 (BOEING)

   SAN SALVADOR, 25 APR 90 (EL DIARIO DE HOY) -- [TEXT] THE HIGH COMMAND OF
THE ARMED FORCES IS ANALYZING NEWS REPORTS ABOUT COLONEL SIGIFREDO OCHOA
PEREZ, PRESIDENT OF AN AUTONOMOUS INSTITUTION, HAVING SAID THAT THE OFFICER
INVOLVED IN THE DEATH OF SIX JESUITS AND THEIR TWO MAIDS "FOLLOWED ORDERS
FROM ABOVE".

   OCHOA MADE THOSE COMMENTS ON A U.S. TELEVISION NEWSCAST AT A TIME
WHEN SEVERAL MEMBERS OF [THE U.S.] CONGRESS WANT TO CUT AID TO EL
SALVADOR AND ARE CONDUCTING THEIR OWN INVESTIGATIONS OF THE CASE.  THE
RESULTS OF THEIR INVESTIGATION WILL BE KNOWN NEXT WEEK.

   DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL RAFAEL HUMBERTO LARIOS CONFIRMED ON THE
MORNING OF 24 APRIL THAT THE HIGH COMMAND IS ANALYZING OCHOA'S
DECLARATIONS AND STRESSED THAT VERSIONS SUCH AS THE ONE ATTRIBUTED TO
THE OFFICIAL USUALLY COME FROM "INTERESTED PARTIES."

   LARIOS, QUESTIONED WHEN HE BID FAREWELL TO PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI, WHO LEFT FOR NICARAGUA ON 24 APRIL, SAID THAT "THE CASE IS
IN THE COURTS AND ALL THOSE WHO HAVE NEW EVIDENCE MAY APPROACH THEM TO
CONTRIBUTE WHAT THEY HAVE SO THAT IT MAY BE SOLVED."

   "BOTH THE ARMY AND THE GOVERNMENT WANT EVERYTHING TO BE CLARIFIED
WITHIN A FAIR AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK," HE SAID.

   ARMY OFFICERS WHO ASKED TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS SAID ON 24 APRIL THAT
"THE COMMENTS MADE BY OCHOA, CONTROVERSIAL POLITICIAN AND SOLDIER
KNOWN FOR HIS FREQUENT OUTBURSTS, HAVE NO BASIS BECAUSE HE HAS NO
ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL ARMED FORCES SOURCES DUE TO HIS RETIRED
STATUS."

   HOWEVER, THE INFORMERS HAVE SAID THAT "WHAT OCHOA SAID NOT ONLY
DAMAGES THE ARMY'S IMAGE, BUT THAT OF THE ENTIRE COUNTRY WHILE IT
CONTRIBUTES TO THE DEFAMATION CAMPAIGN BEING CARRIED OUT ABROAD BY
INTERESTED PARTIES, AMONG THEM, THE LEADERS OF THE FMLN-FDR [FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT-REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATIC FRONT]."

   THEY ADDED THAT OCHOA'S DECLARATION, "MADE WITHOUT PRESENTING ANY
PROOF, ENDANGERS THE MILITARY AID THAT THE UNITED STATES OFFERS TO EL
SALVADOR AND, AT THE SAME TIME, FAVORS THE INTERNATIONALIST LEFT WHICH
INTENDS TO PLAY THE LAST CARD IT HAS TO ASSAULT POWER IN THIS
COUNTRY."

   THE POLITICIANS' IMMEDIATE REACTION TO OCHOA PEREZ' COMMENTS WAS TO
DEMAND THAT HE BE MORE SPECIFIC IN HIS ACCUSATION.  PDC [CHRISTIAN
DEMOCRATIC PARTY] LEADER EDUARDO COLINDRES SAID IN A PRESS CONFERENCE
THAT "OCHOA PEREZ HAS THE MORAL OBLIGATION OF NAMING" THOSE OF HIS
COMRADES-IN-ARMS HE IMPLICATES IN THE DEATH OF THE JESUITS, SINCE THE
VERSION HE GAVE TO THE TELEVISION PROGRAM THAT INTERVIEWED HIM IS
VAGUE.

   THE POLITICIAN SAID: "IF HE KNOWS SOMETHING, IT IS TIME THAT HE
BRING IT OUT INTO A PUBLIC LIGHT SO THAT JUSTICE AUTHORITIES MAY TAKE
THE APPROPRIATE PATHS."

   MEANWHILE, IN MANAGUA, SPANISH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WHO ATTENDED
VIOLETA CHAMORRO'S INAUGURATION SAID THAT THEY WERE DISAPPOINTED BY
THE SLUGGISH MANNER IN WHICH THE INVESTIGATIONS OF THE JESUITS' CASE
ARE APPARENTLY BEING CARRIED OUT.  THEY SAID THAT THEY MIGHT MENTION
THE TOPIC DURING THE MEETINGS THEY WILL HOLD WITH PRESIDENT CRISTIANI
IN NICARAGUA.

   REPORTS FROM WASHINGTON D.C. QUOTE THE LEFTIST LEADER OF THE FDR,
GUILLERMO MANUEL UNGO, AS SAYING THAT "HIS EFFORTS IN THE AMERICAN
CAPITAL TO EXPOSE THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR, ARE A SUCCESS."

   THE SOURCES SAID THAT UNGO AND HIS MARXIST-LENINIST ALLIES WANT THE
U.S. SENATE TO STOP GIVING MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR.  THE SOURCES
ALSO SAID THAT UNGO DISCREDITS THE ARMY AND THE GOVERNMENT AND FAVORS
THE LEGAL RECOGNITION OF THE REBEL GROUPS OPERATING IN THE COUNTRY.

   "EVERYTHING SEEMS TO INDICATE THAT THE LEFTIST INTERNATIONALISTS
HAVE UNLEASHED A NEW DISINFORMATION OFFENSIVE AGAINST EL SALVADOR WITH
THE AID OF BAD SALVADORANS," THE SOURCES SAID.

   REFERRING TO OTHER COMMUNIST MOVES IN THE COUNTRY, GENERAL LARIOS
SAID THAT THE LOCAL LEFTISTS ARE PREPARING TO STAGE TERRORIST ACTIONS
AND STREET DISTURBANCES OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS UNDER THE PRETEXT OF
COMMEMORATING LABOR DAY.

   LARIOS URGED THE FMLN-FDR TERRORISTS TO REFRAIN FROM PERPETRATING
VIOLENT ACTIONS, THUS CREATING AN ADEQUATE CLIMATE FOR THE "DIALOGUE"
ANNOUNCED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO BE HELD ON 3 MAY.  "OTHERWISE, THE
TERRORISTS WOULD BE VIOLATING THE COMMITMENTS THEY MADE," LARIOS
POINTED OUT.

   IN ADDITION, IT HAS BEEN REPORTED FROM COSTA RICA THAT FMLN-FDR
LEADERS HAVE SAID THAT THEY HAVE PREPARED ANOTHER OFFENSIVE FOR THE
NEXT FEW DAYS.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT HAS ELICITED STRONG REJECTION BY
VARIOUS SECTORS.

DEV-MUC3-1254 (BOEING)

   SAN SALVADOR, 1 MAY 90 (CANAL DOCE TELEVISION) -- [TEXT] FOLLOWING A
MEETING OF THE GENERAL STAFF WITH ALL THE BRIGADE AND DETACHMENT COMMANDERS,
THE ARMED FORCES TODAY ISSUED A PUBLIC COMMUNIQUE DESCRIBING THE RECENT
STATEMENTS BY COLONEL SIGIFREDO OCHOA PEREZ AS IRRESPONSIBLE AND
TENDENTIOUS.  IN PARTS, THE COMMUNIQUE POINTED OUT THAT:

   1.  WE EMPHATICALLY AND CATEGORICALLY REJECT THE RECENT STATEMENTS
BY DISCHARGED COL. SIGIFREDO OCHOA PEREZ PUBLISHED IN THE LOCAL AND
FOREIGN MEDIA.  THESE STATEMENTS ARE IRRESPONSIBLE AND TENDENTIOUS AND
SEEK TO CREATE CONFUSION AND DISTRUST IN THE NATIONAL AND
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITIES BY TRYING TO INVOLVE THE MEMBERS OF THE HIGH
COMMAND IN THE REGRETTABLE CASE OF THE DEATH OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS AND
THEIR WORKERS.

   2.  WE DEMAND THAT BOTH COL. OCHOA PEREZ, AS WELL AS ANY OTHER
PERSON HAVING ANY INFORMATION THAT COULD LEAD TO CLARIFYING THIS CASE
OR ANY OTHER CASE, PRESENT IT TO THE CORRESPONDING TRIBUNALS AND NOT
TRY TO OBTAIN POLITICAL PROFIT BASED ON ALLEGED STATEMENTS THAT ARE
ADDED ON TO THE CAMPAIGN OF DISINFORMATION THAT IS BEING CARRIED OUT
IN A SYSTEMATIC MANNER BY NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL MARXIST-LENINIST
TERRORISTS.

   3.  WE CONDEMN SUCH IRRESPONSIBLE STATEMENTS AS THEY SEEK TO
UNDERMINE THE INSTITUTIONALITY OF THE STATE, AND ONLY FAVOR THE DARK
AND NEFARIOUS INTERESTS OF THE ENEMIES OF DEMOCRACY.

   IN CONCLUDING, THE ARMED FORCES COMMUNIQUE REAFFIRMS ITS COMMITMENT
TO THE INSTITUTIONALITY OF THE COUNTRY AND THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND
POINTED OUT THAT THE INSTITUTION IS RULED BY SOLID PROFESSIONAL,
MORAL, AND ETHICAL PRINCIPLES.  WITH THIS STATEMENT, ALL THE
COMMANDERS GIVE THEIR UNCONDITIONAL VOTE OF CONFIDENCE TO THE MILITARY
HIGH COMMAND OF THE ARMED FORCES.

   ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL SOURCES, THE ATTACKS WERE ACCOMPANIED BY
SABOTAGE TO THE ELECTRIC SERVICE SYSTEM.  THE ATTACKS STARTED AT 2030
ON 2 MAY AND CONTINUED UNTIL LATE THIS MORNING. [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   THE NATIONAL ENERGY ENTERPRISE REPORTED THAT ELECTRIC POWER WILL BE
RATIONED FOR AT LEAST FOUR HOURS DURING THIS MORNING IN MOST OF THE
CAPITAL AND OTHER DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.

   MEANWHILE, FMLN SPOKESMEN MADE A TELEPHONE CALL TO A LOCAL RADIO
STATION REPORTING THAT THE MILITARY MANEUVER UNLEASHED ON THE NATIONAL
LEVEL IS AIMED AT PRESSURING THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT TO RENEW
THE DIALOGUE.

   TALKS BETWEEN THE FNLM AND THE GOVERNMENT ARE SCHEDULED TO START
DURING THE FIRST PART OF THIS MONTH, ACCORDING TO UN SECRETARY GENERAL
JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR, WHO IS ACTING AS A MEDIATOR.

   PEREZ DE CUELLAR'S PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE, ALVARO DE SOTO, TODAY

DEV-MUC3-1259 (BOEING)

   MEXICO CITY (MEXICO), 2 MAY 90 (NOTIMEX) -- [TEXT] THE 19 APRIL
MOVEMENT [M - 19] TODAY ACCUSED THE COLOMBIAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES OF
ASSASSINATING M-19 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE CARLOS PIZARRO.

   "WE ATTRIBUTE PIZARRO'S DEATH TO THE COLOMBIAN SECURITY SERVICES,"
SAID M-19 DIRECTORATE MEMBER RAFAEL VERGARA DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE
HELD IN MEXICO CITY.

   THE POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC COMMISSION OF THE FORMER REBEL GROUP
TURNED POLITICAL PARTY HAS PROPOSED THE CREATION OF AN INTERNATIONAL
GROUP TO PERMANENTLY PROTECT THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES' LIVES.

   MIGUEL MARIN, ALSO A MEMBER OF THE M-19'S DIRECTORATE, POINTED OUT
THE NEED FOR VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS TO DESIGNATE
POLITICAL PERSONALITIES WHO WOULD ACCOMPANY EACH OF THE PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATES ON THEIR CAMPAIGNS.

   "WE INTEND TO CHECK THE TRIGGERS OF THE COLOMBIAN OLIGARCHY, WHO
ARE TO BLAME FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF FOUR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES IN
THE PAST FEW YEARS," THE POLITICAL MOVEMENT'S REPRESENTATIVES SAID.

   THEY DENIED THAT THE M-19 IS IN FAVOR OF DRUG TRAFFICKING, BUT
ADVOCATED THE LEGALIZATION OF DRUGS AND THE NONEXTRADITION OF DRUG
PRODUCERS.

   THE M-19 MEMBERS SAID THAT THE CLARIFICATION OF THEIR TOP LEADER'S
DEATH IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE CREDIBILITY OF VIRGILIO BARCO'S REGIME.
THEY SAID THAT PIZARRO'S BASIC PROPOSALS TO PACIFY THE COUNTRY WILL BE
TAKEN UP BY ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF, WHO REPLACED PIZARRO AS THE M-19'S
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.

   THEY ASKED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO HELP PUT AN END TO THE
ARMS TRAFFIC TO COLOMBIA, BECAUSE IN 1989 FOREIGN INVESTMENT INCREASED
BY 148 PERCENT OVER THAT OF 1988.

   "WHAT COLOMBIA NEEDS IS TO ATTAIN PEACE WITH SOCIAL JUSTICE.  FOR
THIS REASON, IT IS NECESSARY TO TALK AND NEGOTIATE WITH ALL OF THE
INFLUENTIAL SECTORS IN COLOMBIA, INCLUDING THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS,"
VERGARA AND MARIN POINTED OUT.

DEV-MUC3-1260 (BOEING)

   SAN SALVADOR, 3 MAY 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] A GROUP PURPORTEDLY
REPRESENTING YOUNG SALVADORAN MILITARY OFFICERS HAS CALLED FOR A PURGE
OF THE ARMED FORCES HERE, ACCUSING THEIR SUPERIORS OF INVOLVEMENT IN
THE MASSACRE OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS.

   THE CALL CAME WEDNESDAY IN THE WAKE OF A BOLD OFFENSIVE BY LEFTIST
GUERRILLAS WHO ATTACKED STRATEGIC TARGETS ACROSS THE CAPITAL,
INCLUDING THE RESIDENCE OF PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI, IN A SHOW OF
FORCE BEFORE PEACE TALKS.

   THE STATEMENT DISTRIBUTED TO NEWS ORGANIZATIONS WAS MADE IN THE
NAME OF A "COMMANDO OF YOUNG OFFICERS."  IT GAVE NO NAMES BUT SAID THE
GROUP WAS FORMED SECRETLY AMONG OFFICERS FED UP WITH CORRUPTION BY A
SMALL GROUP OF MILITARY LEADERS.

   IF AUTHENTIC, THE STATEMENT WOULD MARK THE FIRST TIME SINCE A 1979
MILITARY COUP THAT A GROUP OF JUNIOR OFFICERS HAD BROKEN RANKS WITH EL
SALVADOR'S MILITARY LEADERSHIP.

   "TODAY MORE THAN EVER, ALL THE OFFICERS WHO TRULY WANT TO SAVE OUR
INSTITUTION, MUST DEMAND AND EXACT PROFOUND CHANGES AND A GENERAL
PURGE AT ALL LEVELS OF THE ARMED FORCES," THE STATEMENT SAID.

   THE STATEMENT BLAMED A THREATENED LOSS OF U.S. MILITARY AID ON A
FEW CORRUPT OFFICERS WHOM IT HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE "EXECRABLE"
ASSASSINATIONS OF SIX ROMAN CATHOLIC PRIESTS DURING A REBEL OFFENSIVE
IN NOVEMBER.

   EL SALVADOR IS SUPPOSED TO RECEIVE 315.4 MILLION DOLLARS IN U.S.
AID THIS YEAR, 85 MILLION DOLLARS OF IT IN MILITARY AID.  BUT THE U.S.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HAS VOTED TO CUT MILITARY AID IN HALF AND
U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE JAMES BAKER HAS WARNED THAT AID TO EL SALVADOR
WILL DEPEND ON PROGRESS IN THE PRIESTS' CASE.

   THE PRIESTS, THEIR HOUSEKEEPER AND HER DAUGHTER WERE MURDERED IN
THEIR RESIDENCE NOVEMBER 16 IN THE MIDST OF PROLONGED AND BLOODY
GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE IN THE CITY.  NINE MEMBERS OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED
FORCES HAVE BEEN CHARGED IN THE KILLINGS BUT MR. CRISTIANI HAS
EXPRESSED DOUBTS THAT THEY WILL BE CONVICTED.

   "IT IS TRULY SAD AND INFURIATING FOR US THAT THE LOSS OF PRESTIGE
OF THE ARMED FORCES HAS GROWN SO MUCH THAT INTERNATIONALLY WE ARE SEEN
AS THE ONES TO BLAME FOR THE SITUATION OUR COUNTRY IS IN," SAID THE
STATEMENT ATTRIBUTED TO THE YOUNG OFFICERS.

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN), MEANWHILE,
ALSO SAID ITS ATTACKS IN SAN SALVADOR EARLY WEDNESDAY WERE TO PROTEST
THE LACK OF PROGRESS IN PROSECUTING MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY FOR THE
MASSACRE OF THE PRIESTS.

   BUT ANALYSTS SAID THE RENEWED FIGHTING APPEARED INTENDED AS A SHOW
OF FORCE AHEAD OF U.N.-MEDIATED PEACE [WORD INDISTINCT] THIS MONTH,
WHICH SEEK TO END A DECADE-LONG CIVIL WAR THAT HAS LEFT MORE THAN
70,000 DEAD.

   IN THE FIGHTING EARLY WEDNESDAY, AT LEAST SEVEN GOVERNMENT TROOPS
WERE KILLED AND 18 WERE WOUNDED, AN ARMY SPOKESMAN SAID.  THERE WERE
NO CASUALTIES IN THE ATTACK ON THE PRESIDENTIAL RESIDENCE AND MR.
CRISTIANI WAS NOT AT HOME AT THE TIME, THE SPOKESMAN SAID.

   THE REBELS RETREATED TO THEIR STRONGHOLD AROUND THE SAN SALVADOR
VOLCANO JUST NORTH OF THE CAPITAL AFTER THE ATTACKS IN UPPER CLASS
NEIGHBORHOODS.

   THE UNITED STATES SHARPLY CONDEMNED THE ATTACKS AND CALLED ON THE
REBELS TO DEMONSTRATE THEY CAN WORK WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF EL SALVADOR
TO END THE WAR.

   "WE CONDEMN THE OUTRAGEOUS VIOLENCE BY THE FMLN," SAID STATE
DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN RICHARD BOUCHER.  "THE FMLN HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT
IT CAN DESTROY THE SALVADORAN ECONOMY AND KILL SALVADORAN CITIZENS."

DEV-MUC3-1263 (BOEING)

   SAN SALVADOR, 3 MAY 90 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY MODERATOR AND REPORTERS] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] [MODERATOR] JUAN AMADEO CABRERA FROM LA NOTICIA.

   [CABRERA] MR. PRESIDENT, IF THE COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE YOUNG
MILITARY OFFICERS IS TRUE, IF IT IS TRUE THAT THEY ARE MEMBERS OF THE
ARMED FORCES, WHAT IS THE OUTLOOK FOR THE ARMED FORCES AND FOR YOUR
GOVERNMENT?

   [CRISTIANI] I BELIEVE SOME SPECULATION WOULD BE REQUIRED.  I
BELIEVE THAT AS AN ANONYMOUS LETTER, IT CANNOT BE GIVEN THE CREDIT IT
DESERVES, IF IT WAS WRITTEN BY SOMEONE WHO IS COMPLETELY RESPONSIBLE.
IN THIS REGARD, I REPEAT THAT THE ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN WILLING TO
CONDUCT A PROCESS OF PROFESSIONALIZING AND MODERNIZING.  THEY ARE
TRYING TO IMPROVE THEIR INSTITUTION AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

   [MODERATOR] LUISA MELGAR FROM TELEPRENSA.

   [MELGAR] MR. PRESIDENT, YESTERDAY THE FMLN CARRIED OUT DIFFERENT
ARMED ACTIONS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.  A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED
BY THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND JUSTIFIED THE ACTIONS BECAUSE OF ALLEGED
HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, REPRESSION, AND LACK OF SECURITY FOR
CIVILIANS.  HOW DO YOU VIEW THESE ACTIONS JUST WHEN THE TALKS ARE
ABOUT TO BEGIN?

   [CRISTIANI] I READ THE COMMUNIQUE AND I HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT IT IS
ONE OF THE MOST RIDICULOUS FMLN COMMUNIQUES I HAVE SEEN TO DATE.  IT
IS A JUSTIFICATION THAT IS NOT VERY JUSTIFIABLE, I WOULD SAY.  I
BELIEVE THE EVENTS ON 1 MAY IN THE MORNING CAN CLEARLY BE UNDERSTOOD.
ALL GROUPS WISHING TO PARTICIPATE WERE ABLE TO MARCH PEACEFULLY.
THEIR FREEDOMS ARE NOT BEING REPRESSED. I IMAGINE YOU HAVE ALL HEARD
AND SEEN WHAT THEY SAID AND DID AND THERE WERE NO PROBLEMS.  I FEEL
THAT THIS WAS A WAY TO SEEK NOTORIETY THROUGH THE NEWS.  THIS COULD BE
ONE OF THE REASONS.  THE OTHER REASON COULD BE THAT THEY ARE HAVING
PROBLEMS AMONG THEMSELVES.  WE HAVE INFORMATION TELLING US THAT THERE
ARE DIFFERENCES AMONG THE DIFFERENT GROUPS.  SOME OF THEM VIEW THE
DIALOGUE AS SOMETHING SERIOUS, WHILE OTHERS DO NOT, AND IT COULD BE
THAT THESE PROBLEMS ARE RESULTING IN THESE IRRATIONAL ADVENTURES BY
THE FMLN.  I FEEL THAT AT THIS STAGE OF THE DIALOGUE PROCESS, THEIR
ACTIONS ARE COMPLETELY UNJUSTIFIABLE.  THAT IS NOT ALL.  THEY HAVE
EVEN VIOLATED WHAT THEY HAVE CALLED UNILATERAL GESTURES MADE IN THE
PAST.  THIS SHOWS THE LACK OF SERIOUSNESS AND SINCERITY IN ALL OF
THEM, OR SOME OF THEM, CONCERNING THE OBJECTIVES WE ARE TRYING TO
ACHIEVE WITH THE DIALOGUE PROCESS.

   [CRISTIANI] GUILLERMO PENATE FROM EL DIARIO DE HOY.

   [PENATE] THERE ARE SOME LABOR GROUPS THAT WANT TO BE INCLUDED IN
THE DELEGATION THAT WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE TALKS WITH THE FMLN.
COULD THIS NOT BE SOME SORT OF DISADVANTAGE FOR THE OFFICIAL
DELEGATION, BECAUSE THE OPPOSITE GROUPS COULD GAIN STRENGTH?

   [CRISTIANI] I THINK THAT IS TRUE.  SOME GROUPS HAVE ASKED TO BE
INCLUDED IN THE DELEGATION.  I BELIEVE THE PARTICIPATION OF THE
DIFFERENT GROUPS IS STIPULATED IN THE GENEVA AGREEMENTS.  WE HAVE
ALREADY EXPLAINED HOW THE GOVERNMENT CAN ALLOW FOR THE PARTICIPATION
OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SECTORS OF THE COUNTRY.  WE ARE NOT GOING TO
CHANGE THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION, WHICH IS COMPRISED OF GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS FOR THE MOST PART.  I BELIEVE THAT THE PARTICIPATION OF
MEMBERS OF SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS HAS ALREADY BEEN EXPLAINED IN THE
PAST.

   [MODERATOR] RAUL BELTRAN FROM RADIO CADENA YSKL.

   [BELTRAN] MR. PRESIDENT, OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS WE HAVE LEARNED
ABOUT THE OFFICIAL STATEMENT ISSUED BY THE COMMANDERS OF THE VARIOUS
GARRISONS AND THE HIGH COMMAND.  SINCE YOU ARE THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF
OF THE ARMED FORCES, DO YOU SUPPORT THE DOCUMENT THAT WAS PUBLISHED,
WHICH CONDEMNED THE STATEMENTS MADE BY COL. SIGIFREDO OCHOA PEREZ?

   [CRISTIANI] CONCERNING THAT SITUATION, I HAVE SAID THAT SEVERAL
PEOPLE HAVE MADE STATEMENTS, NOT JUST ONE.  THERE HAS BEEN PUBLIC
SPECULATION AS TO WHAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED IN THE ASSASSINATIONS OF THE
JESUIT PRIESTS AND THE OTHER TWO PEOPLE AND THAT IS NOT RIGHT.  IF
SOMEONE HAS ANY INFORMATION TO CONTRIBUTE, AND IF THAT SOMEONE IS
REALLY INTERESTED IN THE PROGRESS OF JUSTICE IN THIS COUNTRY, HE
SHOULD GO TO THE JUDGE TO GIVE HIM THE INFORMATION.  HE SHOULD NOT
CONTINUE TO SPECULATE IN PUBLIC, BECAUSE IT CONFUSES PEOPLE AND IT
OBSTRUCTS THE JUDICIAL PROCESS.

   I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT NOT LONG AGO A
DELEGATION OF SPANISH LEGAL EXPERTS VISITED THE COUNTRY AND THEY WERE
PLEASED TO SEE HOW THE 4TH CRIMINAL JUDGE WAS HANDLING THE JUDICIAL
PROCESS, AS OPPOSED TO OTHER REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN RELEASED IN THE
UNITED STATES.  HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THAT NO ONE SHOULD SPECULATE IN
PUBLIC AS TO WHAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED.  IF SOMEONE HAS INFORMATION OR
EVIDENCE, HE SHOULD GO TO THE JUDGE, OTHERWISE THERE WILL BE
CONFUSION.  IN THAT REGARD, I BELIEVE THAT THE ARMED FORCES
COMMANDERS' REJECTION OF COL. OCHOA'S STATEMENTS IS JUST THAT.  IN
MANY OF THE STATEMENTS THEY WROTE -- I DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN DRAFTING
THE STATEMENT -- THEY MENTIONED THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO SUPPORT AND
STRENGTHEN THE JUDICIAL PROCESS, BUT THEY CANNOT COME OUT IN PUBLIC
WITH SPECULATION BECAUSE THEY WOULD ONLY CONFUSE PEOPLE.  [CONTINUED]

DEV-MUC3-1277 (BOEING)

   SAN SALVADOR, 7 MAY 90 (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [REPORT] [JULIO
ERNESTO RODRIGUEZ] [TEXT] DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL RAFAEL HUMBERTO
LARIOS STATED TODAY THAT THE OFFICERS WHO COULD SERVE AS WITNESSES IN
THE CASE OF THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS ASSASSINATED AT THE CENTRAL
AMERICAN UNIVERSITY ARE TAKING TRAINING COURSES ABROAD.  HE DENIED THE
OFFICERS LEFT FOR REASONS OTHER FOR THE STRICTLY MILITARY NEED OF
TRAINING.  IF THE JUDGE SO ASKS FOR IT, THEY MAY RETURN TO GIVE THEIR
STATEMENT ON THE JESUITS' CASE, HE SAID.  WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE LOSS OF
THE REGISTRY RECORDING THE ENTRY AND DEPARTURE OF PERSONS FROM THE
MILITARY ACADEMY, GEN. LARIOS SAID HE WAS NOT AWARE OF THIS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [LARIOS] THE CADETS ARE NOW OUT OF THE COUNTRY.  THIS
IS IN LINE WITH A PROGRAM PLANNED WELL IN ADVANCE.  CADETS OF CERTAIN CLASSES
LEAVE TO CONDUCT STUDIES, CHIEFLY IN THE UNITED STATES.  THIS IS NORMAL, AS
IT CORRESPONDS TO A SCHEDULED PLAN.  THEY WILL HAVE TO RETURN AT SOME POINT
WHEN THEY CONCLUDE THEIR STUDIES IN THE UNITED STATES.  THEN WE WILL HAVE
THE TIME AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLARIFY ANY ASPECT OF THIS MATTER.

   [REPORTER] COULD NOT THE JUDGE CALL THEM EARLIER?

   [LARIOS] IF THE JUDGE DEEMS THEIR PRESENCE ADVISABLE, THEY MAY BE
CALLED IMMEDIATELY.

   [REPORTER] REFERRING TO THE ENTRY AND DEPARTURE REGISTRY OF THE
DAY WHEN THE JESUITS WERE KILLED, HOW WILL THIS SITUATION END UP?

   [LARIOS] SO FAR, I CANNOT COMMENT ON THE MATTER.  I AM NOT AWARE
OF THE SITUATION.  WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED. [END RECORDING]

   GEN. LARIOS FEELS THAT THE JESUITS' CASE HAS HAD A GREAT BEARING ON
THE CONDITIONS PLACED ON THE MILITARY AID THE U.S. SENATE WILL
APPROVE.  THE MILITARY CHIEF REGRETTED IT IS NOT UP TO THE SALVADORAN
ARMY TO SAY WHEN THE AID MUST BE CUT.  THE U.S. LAWMAKERS HAVE THEIR
MEANS AND CRITERIA TO DECIDE WHEN TO CUT AID, HE SAID REFERRING TO THE
DECISION BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.  THE U.S.  ADMINISTRATION HAS SAID IT
WILL CUT MILITARY AID BY 50 PERCENT IF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT DOES
NOT TRY THE PERSONS GUILTY OF MURDERING SIX JESUITS AND TWO OTHERS.
THE AID WILL BE CUT IF THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT DOES NOT TRY TO OBTAIN
SPECIFIC AGREEMENTS IN THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GUERRILLAS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [LARIOS] WE ALL KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN REGARDING THE
MILITARY AID.  UNFORTUNATELY, WE MUST ADMIT WE CANNOT DECIDE THE TERMS UNDER
WHICH WE WILL RECEIVE THAT MILITARY AID.  THEY MUST DO THAT.  THEY WILL
DECIDE WHEN AND BY HOW MUCH THAT AID WILL BE CUT.

   [REPORTER] GENERAL, DO YOU THINK THAT THE 60 MINUTES PROGRAM IN
WHICH COL.OCHOA PEREZ PARTICIPATED WAS INFLUENTIAL IN THE DECISION TO
ASK THE THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO CUT THE AID?

   [LARIOS] I THINK THAT IT HAS DEFINITELY BEEN INFLUENTIAL.  WE MUST
UNDOUBTEDLY RECOGNIZE THIS.  NEVERTHELESS, THAT IS NOT ALL.  I BELIEVE
THAT THE SITUATION EXISTED EVEN BEFORE THE 60 MINUTES PROGRAM WAS
BROADCAST.  THEREFORE, I BELIEVE THAT THE PROBLEM EXISTED REGARDLESS
OF WHAT WAS SAID DURING THE 60 MINUTES PROGRAM, AND WE WERE [WORDS
INDISTINCT].

   [REPORTER] WHAT WERE THE ISSUES WHICH HAD ALREADY DETERMINED THIS?
WHAT COULD THEY BE?

   [LARIOS] THAT IS REALLY NOTHING NEW.  THE JESUITS' CASE HAS BEEN,
LET US SAY, THE DECISIVE FACTOR FOR DECIDING ONE THING OR ANOTHER IN
THE U.S. CONGRESS, SENATE, AND ADMINISTRATION ABOUT THE MILITARY AID.
THAT IS BASICALLY THE ISSUE. [END RECORDING]

   GEN. LARIOS ALSO TALKED ABOUT POSSIBLE CHANGES WHICH MIGHT OCCUR IN
THE ARMY LEADERSHIP.  RECENT RUMORS INDICATE THAT HE MIGHT LEAVE HIS
POST AS DEFENSE MINISTER, AND THAT CHANGES MIGHT OCCUR WITHIN THE
ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND.  HE SAID THAT HE DOES NOT RULE OUT THE
POSSIBILITY THAT THESE CHANGES MAY OCCUR, BUT HE TERMED THEM AS
ROUTINE.

   REFERRING TO A U.S. TELEVISION PROGRAM WHICH IMPLIED COLONEL
ORLANDO ZEPEDA'S PARTICIPATION IN THE JESUITS' CASE, THE DEFENSE
MINISTER SAID HE DOES NOT BELIEVE THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION BECAUSE THE
DEPUTY DEFENSE MINISTER IS A COLLEAGUE WHO ONLY HANDLES ADMINISTRATIVE
ISSUES WITHIN THE ARMY.

   ALSO AFFECTED ARE CANDIDATES GUILLERMO ALEMAN, POPULAR SINGER AND
CUMBIA COMPOSER MARIO GARENA, JAIRO RODRIGUEZ LEON, AND HENRY FARFAN
SILVA, WHO HAD ALREADY RESIGNED, ALTHOUGH NONE OF THEM HAD ANY CHANCE
OF WINNING.

   ACCORDING TO THE SUPREME COURT, THE STATE OF SIEGE MUST ONLY BE
CONSIDERED WHEN ISSUING DECREES DEALING WITH THE RESTORING OF PUBLIC
ORDER, WHICH DOES NOT CONTEMPLATE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.

   THE COLOMBIAN LAWS DEMAND THAT A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE MUST BE OR
HAS BEEN A PARLIAMENTARIAN, UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR, AMBASSADOR, OR
ATTORNEY GENERAL, AND HAS BEEN A PROFESSIONAL FOR AT LEAST FIVE YEARS.

   NONETHELESS, THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION IS NOT RETROACTIVE AND
THE CANDIDACIES WILL BE WITHDRAWN ONLY IF THEY ARE OFFICIALLY
CHALLENGED.

   QUITO, 14 MAY 90 (RADIO QUITO) -- [TEXT] ERNESTO BUENANO AND JAIME
GALARZA, AUTHORS OF THE BOOKS PLANNED CRIME AND WHO KILLED ROLDOS, ARE
SCHEDULED TO TESTIFY ON TUESDAY, 15 MAY, BEFORE THE CONGRESS' MULTIPARTY
COMMISSION THAT IS INVESTIGATING THE DEATH OF FORMER PRESIDENT JAIME ROLDOS
AGUILERA.

   ERNESTO BUENANO SAID THAT IN TOMORROW'S MEETING HE WILL REVEAL THE
NAMES OF THOSE INVOLVED IN JAIME ROLDOS AGUILERA'S DEATH, AND HE WILL
PRESENT THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTS.  HE ALSO REQUESTED THAT THE
COMMISSION MEETING BE HELD IN PUBLIC.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [BUENANO] WE WANT TO THANK REPORTERS LIKE YOU
BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING FOR EIGHT YEARS.  WE HAVE DEDICATED
EIGHT YEARS TO INVESTIGATING PRESIDENT ROLDOS' ACCIDENT, AND IT WAS
NOT UNTIL TODAY THAT WE WERE SUMMONED TO TESTIFY BEFORE THE MULTIPARTY
COMMISSION.

   THIS STRUGGLE [WORDS INDISTINCT] IS NOTHING BUT THE RESULTS OF THE
EFFORTS EXERTED MY MANY REPORTERS LIKE YOU, WHO HAVE HELPED US SO
SELFLESSLY AND WHO HAVE NOT TRIED TO WITHHOLD THE INFORMATION.  I
BELIEVE THAT THIS DESERVES PRAISE AND I AM GRATEFUL FOR THIS.

   IN REGARD TO WHAT WE WILL SAY TOMORROW, WE WILL PROVE TO THE
COUNTRY THAT THE SO-CALLED HUMAN FAILURE [WHICH REPORTEDLY CAUSED THE
ACCIDENT] IS A LIE.  SECOND, WE WILL PROVE HOW THE CIA ACTS ON THE
INTERNATIONAL LEVEL; WHO ITS AGENTS ARE IN ECUADOR AND THEIR NAMES;
AND WHAT CAUSED THE PRESIDENTIAL PLANE CRASH, WHICH WE HAVE TERMED A
HOMICIDE.  WE WILL TELL THE COUNTRY WHO THE MAIN POLITICAL CONSPIRATOR
WAS AGAINST PRESIDENT ROLDOS.  WE WILL PROVE THIS WITH DOCUMENTS
BECAUSE WE WILL NOT BE TALKING ABOUT [WORDS INDISTINCT].  WE WILL
REVEAL WHAT THIS POLITICAL CONSPIRATOR SAID BEFORE THE PRESIDENT'S
DEATH AND AFTER HIS ASSASSINATION. [END RECORDING]

DEV-MUC3-1291 (BOEING)

   CARACAS (VENEZUELA), 18 MAY 90 (DPA) -- [TEXT] GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT
VINICIO CEREZO SAID TODAY IN CARACAS THAT HE "FIRMLY BELIEVES" THAT A
SALVADORAN RIGHT-WING POLITICAL GROUP PARTICIPATED IN THE ASSASSINATION IN
GUATEMALA OF SALVADORAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LEADER HECTOR OQUELI AND HIS
COMPANION GILDA FLORES IN LATE JANUARY.

   IN A NEWS CONFERENCE TODAY AT THE AYACUCHO ROOM OF THE MIRAFLORES
[PRESIDENTIAL] PALACE, CEREZO SAID HE WILL DELIVER A DETAILED REPORT
ON THIS CASE TO VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ, TO SOCIALIST
INTERNATIONAL, AND TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT, TO WHICH HE REQUESTED
ALL THE NECESSARY ASSISTANCE TO IDENTIFY AND DETAIN THE ASSASSINS.

   REFERRING TO THE TALKS BEING HELD WITH THE VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT TO
RENEGOTIATE IN CONCEPT THE OIL DEBT THAT GUATEMALA HAS WITH VENEZUELA
-- WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT -- CEREZO SAID
PRESIDENT PEREZ HAD ACCEPTED THE [RESTRUCTURING] PROPOSAL.  HOWEVER,
THE TERMS ARE STILL BEING DISCUSSED.

   THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT REQUESTED 20 YEARS TO PAY THE DEBT, A
SIX-YEAR GRACE PERIOD, AND A FOUR-YEAR [GRACE PERIOD] ON THE INTEREST.
THIS PROPOSAL WILL BE PRESENTED TO THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT (WHICH ALONG
WITH VENEZUELA PARTICIPATES IN THE OIL SUPPLY AGREEMENT).  THE
PROPOSAL WILL THEN BE PRESENTED AT THE UPCOMING CENTRAL AMERICAN
PRESIDENTS SUMMIT.

   DURING THE NEWS CONFERENCE WITH VENEZUELAN AND FOREIGN JOURNALISTS,
THE GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT, WHO ARRIVED ON 17 MAY IN VENEZUELA, SAID
THAT TO CONSOLIDATE PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO HAVE
GRADUAL DEMILITARIZATION, WITH THE RESULTING REDUCTION IN WEAPONS AND
LOCAL ARMIES, "WHICH SHOULD BE LEFT UNSUITED TO CARRY OUT EXTERNAL
ATTACKS."

   CONCERNING NICARAGUA, CEREZO SAID THE PROFESSIONALIZATION AND
IDEOLOGICAL INDEPENDENCE OF THE ARMY IS FUNDAMENTAL TO REAFFIRMING ITS
DEMOCRACY.

DEV-MUC3-1292 (BOEING)

   GUATEMALA CITY, 19 MAY 90 (DPA) -- [TEXT] THE BUS STRIKE IN
GUATEMALA CITY CONTINUED FOR THE FOURTH DAY TODAY.  LAST NIGHT, THERE
WERE NEW DISTURBANCES AND TERRORIST BOMBS WERE SET OFF.

   ALTHOUGH THE SITUATION HAS CAUSED GREAT DISCONTENT AMONG THE 1.2
MILLION PEOPLE OF THE CAPITAL, THE GOVERNMENT HAS FOR THE TIME BEING
REJECTED THE MUNICIPALITY'S REQUEST TO PLACE THE BUS SERVICES UNDER
MILITARY CONTROL.

   THE BUS OWNERS ARE ASKING FOR A 100-PERCENT INCREASE IN THE 20
CENTAVO ($.05) FARE, ARGUING THAT INFLATION HAS INCREASED THE PRICE OF
GASOLINE AND THE BUS MAINTENANCE COSTS.  HOWEVER, THE MUNICIPALITY HAS
NOT AUTHORIZED THE INCREASE, FEARING A GENERALIZED PROTEST BY BUS
PASSENGERS.

DEV-MUC3-1293 (BOEING)

   HAVANA (CUBA), 18 MAY 90 (INTERNATIONAL SERVICE) -- [COMMENTARY]
[TEXT] NINE YEARS AGO TODAY, THEN ECUADORAN PRESIDENT JAIME ROLDOS
AGUILERA DIED WHEN HIS PLANE CRASHED WHILE ON A FLIGHT TO THE INTERIOR
OF HIS COUNTRY. THE SMALL PLANE SUFFERED THE ACCIDENT WHILE FLYING THE
PRESIDENT, HIS WIFE, AND A DELEGATION THAT INCLUDED HIGH- RANKING ARMY
OFFICERS FROM QUITO TO LOJA PROVINCE.  ALL OF THEM DIED.  THE
RELATIVES OF THE LATE PRESIDENT EXPRESSED DOUBTS THAT THE PLANE
CRASHED ACCIDENTALLY AND FILED CHARGES AS PRIVATE CITIZENS, BUT THE
CASE WAS LATER CLOSED.

   DOUBTS HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED SEVERAL TIMES ABOUT THE ALLEGED
ACCIDENT, AND THE CASE RESURFACED AGAIN WHEN A NEW INVESTIGATION WAS
OPENED AND ONE OF THE WITNESSES DISCLOSED THAT THERE IS EVIDENCE OF
PARTICIPATION BY THE U.S. CIA IN THE DEATH OF ROLDOS AND HIS RETINUE.
ERNESTO BUENANO, ROLDOS' POLITICAL ADVISER, ASSERTED BEFORE A
MULTIPARTY COMMISSION OF THE ECUADORAN CONGRESS THAT THE PLANE
ACCIDENT IN WHICH THE FORMER PRESIDENT DIED DID NOT RESULT FROM HUMAN
ERROR OR TECHNICAL FAILURE BUT FROM SABOTAGE, WHICH CONSISTED OF
CONTAMINATING THE PLANE'S FUEL TO CAUSE ITS ENGINES TO STALL.  THE
WITNESS POINTED OUT THAT THERE IS INCONTESTABLE EVIDENCE ABOUT THIS
AND URGED THE COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE THE PERSONS WHO WERE
RESPONSIBLE FOR SUPPLYING FUEL TO THE PRESIDENT'S PLANE.

   IT IS WORTH MENTIONING THAT ROLDOS' ADMINISTRATION WAS
CHARACTERIZED BY A PROGRESSIVE ORIENTATION, AND MORE SPECIFICALLY BY
HIS DIRECT OPPOSITION TO U.S. ATTEMPTS TO DOMINATE THE LATIN AMERICAN
COUNTRIES.  THE FORMER PRESIDENT WAS OPENLY IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE
SANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT OF NICARAGUA AND THE SALVADORAN
INSURGENTS.  HIS ADOPTION OF THIS STANCE LED U.S.  IMPERIALISM TO
CONSIDER THE ROLDOS DOCTRINE AS A DANGER TO ITS INTERESTS.

   WHEN ONE RECALLS THE POSITION OF THE FORMER ECUADORAN PRESIDENT,
THE DISAPPEARANCE OF FORMER PANAMANIAN LEADER OMAR TORRIJOS HERRERA
ALSO COMES TO MIND.  TORRIJOS' DEATH WAS SIMILAR IN CIRCUMSTANCES TO
THAT OF JAIME ROLDOS, AND HIS PATRIOTIC ATTITUDE WITH REGARD TO HIS
COUNTRY'S SOVEREIGNTY WAS ALSO SIMILAR.  TORRIJOS AND ROLDOS WERE A
NUISANCE TO U.S. PLANS IN LATIN AMERICA AND BOTH WERE MURDERED, AS
VARIOUS SOURCES HAVE DISCLOSED.  FORMER CHILEAN PRESIDENT SALVADOR
ALLENDE [WORDS INDISTINCT] IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT THE CIA'S HAND
DIRECTLY TOOK HIS LIFE, THE ORGANIZATION DID HELP DESTABILIZE HIS
PROGRESSIVE GOVERNMENT.

   THE INVESTIGATIONS ON JAIME ROLDOS' DEATH AND WHAT WAS SAID AT THE
TIME ABOUT THE ALLEGED ACCIDENT SUFFERED BY OMAR TORRIJOS REVEAL ONCE
MORE THE SINISTER PLANS OF THE U.S. CIA AGAINST OUR LATIN AMERICAN AND
CARIBBEAN PEOPLE, WHO MUST REMAIN ON THE ALERT.

DEV-MUC3-1296 (BOEING)

   SAN SALVADOR, 21 MAY 90 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] A MILITARY SPOKESMAN
HAS REPORTED THAT ONE CIVILIAN WAS KILLED AND FIVE OTHER PEOPLE,
INCLUDING A POLICEMAN, WERE INJURED TODAY AS A RESULT OF THE EXPLOSION
OF A GRENADE THROWN AT A POLICE PATROL CAR BY ALLEGED URBAN GUERRILLA
COMMANDOS.

   THE CIVILIAN WHO WAS KILLED HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS JOSE OVIDIO
GOMEZ, A TAXI DRIVER, AND THE INJURED POLICEMAN IS RICARDO ANTONIO
MARTINEZ.  MARTINEZ AND THE OTHER PERSONS WHO WERE INJURED, SOME
SERIOUSLY, WERE TAKEN TO A SAN SALVADOR MEDICAL CENTER.

   ACCORDING TO THE SOURCE, THE GRENADE WAS THROWN AT 0630 (1230 GMT)
TODAY.  THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE NEAR THE CENTRAL MARKETPLACE, SAN
SALVADOR'S MOST IMPORTANT SUPPLY CENTER, WHICH IS VERY CROWDED AT THAT
TIME OF DAY.

   THE SOURCE ATTRIBUTED THE ATTACK TO URBAN GUERRILLA COMMANDOS, BUT
THE GUERRILLAS HAVE NOT CLAIMED CREDIT FOR IT.

   THIS IS THE FIRST ATTACK THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE IN THE SALVADORAN
CAPITAL SINCE THE PEACE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT BEGAN LAST WEDNESDAY IN
VENEZUELA.

   THE TALKS ARE IN THEIR SIXTH DAY TODAY AND THERE IS AN ATMOSPHERE
OF OPTIMISM.  ACCORDING TO SOURCES CLOSE TO THE DIALOGUE, IMPORTANT
PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE TO SECURE THE PACIFICATION OF EL SALVADOR,
WHICH FOR A DECADE HAS BEEN ENDURING A CIVIL WAR IN WHICH MORE THAN
70,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED.

DEV-MUC3-1299 (BOEING)

   BOGOTA, 21 MAY 90 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [SPEECH]
[PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO] [TEXT] FELLOW COUNTRYMEN: I ADDRESS YOU AT
A MOMENT WHEN ALL GOOD COLOMBIANS ARE FILLED WITH PAIN.  TERRORIST
ACTIONS HAVE BROUGHT SADNESS AND MOURNING TO DOZENS OF OUR POOR HOMES,
AS WELL AS TO FAMILIES OF NATIONAL LEADERS.  COLOMBIA'S ENEMIES HAVE
DEDICATED THEMSELVES TO ATTACKING UNARMED CITIZENS.  THEIR INSANE
ACTIONS ARE ENDING THE LIVES OF INNOCENT CHILDREN, WOMEN, AND HONEST
COLOMBIANS.  AT THESE TRYING TIMES, I SEND ALL THOSE WHO HAVE SUFFERED
THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS IRRATIONAL WAVE OF MONSTROUS CRIMES MY
DEEPEST SENTIMENTS OF SOLIDARITY.  I WANT TO TELL ALL THE VICTIMS'
RELATIVES AND FRIENDS THAT WE SHARE THEIR SORROW AND SADNESS.

   THE COUNTRY AND ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT HAVE BEEN DEALT A STRONG BLOW
TODAY.  ANOTHER GREAT MAN HAS BEEN ASSASSINATED.  LIBERAL LEADER
FEDERICO ESTRADA VELEZ WAS VIOLENTLY MURDERED IN THE STREETS OF
MEDELLIN.  THE LOSS OF SENATOR ESTRADA VELEZ LEAVES THE LIBERAL PARTY
AND ANTIOQUIANS WITHOUT ONE OF ITS GREAT LEADERS.  HE IS TO BE ADDED
TO THE LIST OF MARTYRS THAT HAVE BEEN MURDERED FOR THEIR THOUGHTS AND
BRAVE ATTITUDE IN CONFRONTING THE COUNTRY'S PROBLEMS.  FEDERICO
ESTRADA WAS A FIGHTER IN THIS ADMINISTARTION AND, AS OUR COLOMBIAN
AMBASSADOR TO ITALY, CONTRIBUTED TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF RELATIONS WITH
THAT COUNTRY AND WITH THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY.  THE COUNTRY RECALLS HIM
FOR HIS RECENT ACTIONS AS THE PROPONENT AND PROMOTER OF THE
CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS PROJECT AT THE SENATE.  HIS BRILLANT POLITICAL
AND PROFESSIONAL CAREER ALLOWED HIM TO REACH THE HIGHEST POSITIONS OF
THE COLOMBIAN CONGRESS AND OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH.  HE WAS A SUPREME
COURT MAGISTRATE, UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR, PARLIAMENTARIAN, THE NATIONAL
AND DEPARTMENTAL LEADER OF THE LIBERAL PARTY, A PUBLIC SERVANT OF MANY
YEARS, AND A TIRELESS WORKER FOR THE WELLBEING OF THE PEOPLE OF
ANTIOQUA.  HIS LIFE WAS ENDED AT A TIME WHEN THE COUNTRY AND HIS PARTY
NEEDED HIS EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE.

   TO HIS WIFE, HIS FOUR CHILDREN, HIS FOLLOWERS, AND ALL ANTIOQUEANS,
I SEND A HEARTFELT MESSAGE OF CONDOLENCE IN THE NAME OF ALL HIS FELLOW
COUNTRYMEN.  THE PEOPLE ARE SICK OF THIS IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE.  ALL
COLOMBIANS GET ANGRY EACH TIME A BARBARIC ACT TAKES PLACE AND EACH
TIME ONE OF OUR LEADERS IS MURDERED.  LET US TURN THIS ANGER INTO A
PUBLIC CONDEMNATION OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE ACTIONS, IN A
DECIDED ACTION BY ALL AGAINST THE EMPIRE OF CRIME, AND IN EFFECTIVE
SOLIDARITY WITH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.  RECOVERING PEACE AND
TRANQUILLITY IS A JOINT TASK.  EVERY DAY WE MUST DEMAND MORE
EFFICIENCY FROM OUR PUBLIC FORCES BUT WE MUST ALSO GIVE THEM MORE
SOLIDARITY AND SUPPORT SO THAT THEY CAN EFFICIENTLY COMPLY WITH THEIR
SERIOUS RESPONSIBILITIES.  THIS IS WHAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN DOING;
IT HAS SUPPORTED THEM MORALLY AND MATERIALLY.

   TO DEFEAT TERRORISM AND IMPUNITY DEPENDS ABOVE ALL ON THE
COOPERATION OF CITIZENS.  WE MUST ALL BECOME LIKE SOLDIERS IN THE
SEARCH FOR PEACE BECAUSE THE FUTURE OF OUR FAMILIES, OUR PRINCIPLES,
OUR RIGHTS, AND OUR DEMOCRACY ARE AT STAKE.  LET THOSE WHO PROMOTE
VIOLENCE FACE AN INVINCIBLE ARMY OF 30 MILLION HONEST COLOMBIANS.  NO
ONE SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS PAINFUL MOMENT THE COUNTRY IS
ENDURING.  THE INTERESTS OF COLOMBIA ARE ABOVE ALL OTHER
CONSIDERATIONS.

   ON THE EVE OF THE ELECTIONS AND THE DECISION BY THE HONORABLE
SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY, AND AFTER A
THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF THE MOST RECENT PUBLIC ORDER DISTURBANCES, I HAVE
DEEMED IT APPROPRIATE TO SEND THE FOREIGN MINISTER TO REPRESENT
COLOMBIA AT THE ANDEAN GROUP PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT.

   AS YOU ARE AWARE, THE ANDEAN GROUP PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT WILL BEGIN
TOMORROW IN CUZCO, PERU.  THIS MEETING WAS CALLED WITH THE OBJECTIVE
OF ACHIEVING NEW PROGRESS IN THE INTEGRATION OF THE SUBREGION, THROUGH
NEW MECHANISMS FOR INTEGRATION AND WITH THE CREATION OF THE ANDEAN
PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL.

   THE FOREIGN MINISTER WILL BE ENTRUSTED WITH REAFFIRMING COLOMBIA'S
FULL COMMITMENT TO THE INTEGRATION PROCESS AND TO CONCERTED NEW JOINT
ACTIONS WITH PERU, ECUADOR, BOLIVIA, AND VENEZUELA TO FACE THE PROBLEM
OF THE CONSUMPTION, SMUGGLING, AND DRUG PRODUCTION.

   FELLOW COUNTRYMEN: I HEREBY REITERATE MY DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO ALL
THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY VIOLENCE.  IT IS AT THIS TIME OF
SORROW AND SADNESS WHEN WE COLOMBIANS SHOULD BE MORE UNITED THAN EVER.
I WANT TO INVITE YOU TO USE THE SUFFERING AND THE MEMORIES OF THOSE
WHO HAVE FALLEN AS A FORCE THAT WILL GIVE US MORE COURAGE AND
DETERMINATION TO CONTINUE TO PROGRESS IN BUILDING COLOMBIA IN PEACE,
FREE OF TERRORISM AND VIOLENCE.  GOOD NIGHT.
