   SAN SALVADOR, 18 FEB 90 (DPA) -- [TEXT] HEAVY FIGHTING WITH AIR
SUPPORT RAGED LAST NIGHT IN NORTHWESTERN SAN SALVADOR WHEN MEMBERS OF
THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] ATTACKED AN
ELECTRIC POWER SUBSTATION.  ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY REPORTS, A
SOLDIER GUARDING THE SUBSTATION WAS WOUNDED.

   THE FIRST EXPLOSIONS BEGAN AT 2330 [0530 GMT] AND CONTINUED UNTIL
EARLY THIS MORNING, WHEN GOVERNMENT TROOPS REQUESTED AIR SUPPORT AND
THE GUERRILLAS WITHDREW TO THE SLOPES OF THE SAN SALVADOR VOLCANO,
WHERE THEY ARE NOW BEING PURSUED.

   THE NOISE FROM THE ARTILLERY FIRE AND HELICOPTER GUNSHIPS WAS HEARD
THROUGHOUT THE CAPITAL AND ITS OUTSKIRTS, ESPECIALLY IN THE CROWDED
NEIGHBORHOODS OF NORTHERN AND NORTHWESTERN SAN SALVADOR, SUCH AS
MIRALVALLE, SATELITE, MONTEBELLO, AND SAN RAMON.  SOME EXPLOSIONS
COULD STILL BE HEARD THIS MORNING.

   MEANWHILE, IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE CITIES OF SAN MIGUEL AND
USULUTAN, THE LARGEST CITIES IN EASTERN EL SALVADOR, HAVE NO
ELECTRICITY BECAUSE OF GUERRILLA SABOTAGE ACTIVITY.

   BOGOTA, 30 AUG 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 2) -- [TEXT] LAST
NIGHT'S TERRORIST TARGET WAS THE ANTIOQUIA LIQUEUR PLANT. FOUR
POWERFUL ROCKETS WERE GOING TO EXPLODE VERY CLOSE TO THE TANKS WHERE
300,000 GALLONS OF THE SO-CALLED CASTILLE CRUDE, USED TO OPERATE THE
BOILERS, IS STORED. THE WATCHMEN ON DUTY REPORTED THAT AT 2030 THEY
SAW A MAN AND A WOMAN LEAVING A SMALL SUITCASE NEAR THE FENCE THAT
SURROUNDS THE PLANT. THE WATCHMEN EXCHANGED FIRE WITH THE TERRORISTS
WHO FLED LEAVING BEHIND THE EXPLOSIVE MATERIAL THAT ALSO INCLUDED
DYNAMITE AND GRENADE ROCKET LAUNCHERS. METROPOLITAN POLICE PERSONNEL
SPECIALIZING IN EXPLOSIVES, DEFUSED THE ROCKETS. SOME 100 PEOPLE WERE
WORKING INSIDE THE PLANT.

   THE DAMAGE THE ROCKETS WOULD HAVE CAUSED HAD THEY BEEN ACTIVATED
CANNOT BE ESTIMATED BECAUSE THE CARIBE SODA FACTORY AND THE GUAYABAL
RESIDENTIAL AREA WOULD HAVE ALSO BEEN AFFECTED.

   THE ANTIOQUIA LIQUEUR PLANT HAS RECEIVED THREATS IN THE PAST AND
MAXIMUM SECURITY HAS ALWAYS BEEN PRACTICED IN THE AREA. SECURITY WAS
STEPPED UP LAST NIGHT AFTER THE INCIDENT. THE LIQUEUR INDUSTRY IS THE
LARGEST FOREIGN EXCHANGE PRODUCER FOR THE DEPARTMENT.

   BOGOTA, 18 AUG 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [EXCERPTS]
THE EXTRADITABLES TODAY CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MURDER OF
ANTIOQUIA POLICE COMMANDER COLONEL WALDEMAR FRANKLIN QUINTERO, WHICH
OCCURRED THIS MORNING IN MEDELLIN.  THE CRIMINAL ATTACK ON THE OFFICER
OCCURED A SCANT 1 MONTH AFTER THE MURDER OF ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT
GOVERNOR ANTONIO ROLDAN BETANCUR.

   A POLICEMAN WAS KILLED AND ANOTHER POLICEMAN WOUNDED DURING THE
TERRORIST ATTACK.  COL QUINTERO DID NOT HAVE A POLICE ESCORT BY HIS
OWN BEHEST.  COL QUINTERO WAS DIRECTING OPERATIONS AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKING AND CONSEQUENTLY HAD BEEN THE OBJECT OF DEATH THREATS.
HERE IS A REPORT BY GLADYS VARGAS FROM MEDELLIN.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [VARGAS] THIS MORNING ANTIOQUIA POLICE COMMANDER
COL WALDEMAR FRANKLIN QUINTERO LEFT HIS RESIDENCE TO BEGIN HIS DAILY
TASKS AT ANTIOQUIA POLICE HEADQUARTERS.  AS THE VEHICLE DROVE THROUGH
THE AMERICA NEIGHBORHOOD, SEVEN BLOCKS FROM WHERE ANTIOQUIA GOVERNOR
ANTONIO ROLDAN WAS KILLED, THE VEHICLE THAT COL QUINTERO WAS IN -- A
WHITE NISSAN PATROL VEHICLE WITH LICENSE PLATES ME-7847 -- DREW TO A
STOP IN FRONT OF A RED LIGHT AT THE CARRERA 80 CROSSING.  SEVERAL
INDIVIDUALS IN A GRAY MAZDA 626 VEHICLE, WITH LICENSE PLATES MI-1630,
TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS CIRCUMSTANCE TO FIRE VOLLEYS OF SUBMACHINEGUN
FIRE AGAINST COL QUINTERO, WHO DIED INSTANTLY.  [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   COL QUINTERO DID NOT HAVE A POLICE ESCORT.  JUST 8 DAYS AGO HE
DECIDED TO DISMISS THE ESCORT, BECAUSE HE DID NOT WANT ANYONE ELSE TO
BE KILLED IF THERE WERE AN ATTACK ON HIM.  ONLY COL QUINTERO AND A
POLICE DRIVER WERE IN THE VEHICLE.

   THE JUDGE OF THE 76TH DISTRICT COURT, WHO DIRECTED THE REMOVAL OF
THE BODY, SAID THAT SEVERAL TYPES OF WEAPONS WERE USED IN THE ATTACK
AND MORE THAN 100 SHOTS WERE FIRED. [PASSAGE OMITTED] [END RECORDING]

   SAN SALVADOR, 26 MAY 90 (EL DIARIO DE HOY) -- [TEXT] TO DATE, THE
ARMY HAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF A REPORT THAT THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT HAS
SAID IT SENT TO PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI ON THE INVESTIGATIONS
CARRIED OUT IN THAT COUNTRY CONCERNING THE DEATH OF SALVADORAN LEFTIST
LEADER HECTOR OQUELI COLINDRES.

   OQUELI, LEADER OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MNR) AND
HILDA FLORES, A GUATEMALAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LEADER WERE ABDUCTED AND
KILLED IN JANUARY BY UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS IN GUATEMALA CITY AS
THEY WERE HEADING TO THE LA AURORA AIRPORT.

   PRESIDENT CEREZO WAS IN CARACAS ON THE OCCASION OF THE MEETING
BETWEEN THE FMLN-FDR [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT -
REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATIC FRONT] AND A DELEGATION OF THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT.  ON THAT OCCASION PRESIDENT CEREZO MET WITH BOTH
DELEGATIONS SEPARATELY.  HE INFORMED THEM ABOUT THE INVESTIGATIONS
BEING CONDUCTED CONCERNING THE CRIME AND TOLD THEM THAT HE WOULD SEND
HIS GOVERNMENT'S VERSION TO PRESIDENT CRISTIANI.

   SINCE PRESIDENT CEREZO TOLD JOURNALISTS THAT "SALVADORAN RIGHTIST
SECTORS AND SOLDIERS" COULD BE IMPLICATED IN THE CRIME, YESTERDAY ARMY
SPOKESMEN WERE ASKED TO COMMENT ON THE SUBJECT.  THEY SAID THAT
ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE HEARD SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT, THEY HAVE NO
SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE REPORT, WHICH THEY EXPECT TO SEE SOON, IF
IT IS NOT JUST SPECULATION.

   SAN SALVADOR, 26 JAN 90 (CANAL DOCE TELEVISION) -- [REPORT]
[MAURICIO FUNES] [TEXT] AFTER NEARLY A 2-MONTH ABSENCE FROM THE
NATIONAL PRESS, MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON HOLDS THE VIEW THAT THE
ARMED FORCES SHOULD NOT BE CRITICIZED FOR THE ISOLATED BEHAVIOR OF
SOME OF ITS MEMBERS.  THE ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE]
LEADER IS OF THE OPINION THAT THE ARMED FORCES THEMSELVES WERE THE
ONES THAT EXERTED PRESSURE SO THAT THE JESUITS' MURDER CASE COULD BE
CLEARED-UP.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [D'AUBUISSON] IT WAS NOT THE INSTITUTION [ARMED
FORCES] THAT WAS INVOLVED IN THE PROBLEM.  REGRETTABLY SOME OF ITS
MEMBERS DID IT AND NOW THE ENTIRE ARMED FORCES ARE UNDER PRESSURE FOR
POLITICAL REASONS.  HOWEVER, WE MUST REALIZE THAT IT IS THANKS TO THE
ARMED FORCES THAT WE HAVE THIS DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, WITH A HOPE THAT
OUR COUNTRY DEVELOPS AND RECOVERS.  IT IS VERY UNFAIR THAT SOME PEOPLE
PASS JUDGMENT OR CRITICIZE WITHOUT REALLY KNOWING HOW HARD IT HAS BEEN
ON ALL THE OFFICERS, NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS, AND TROOPS WHO HAVE HAD
TO PUT UP WITH THESE ATTACKS IN ADDITION TO THE INTENSE WORK THEY HAVE
HAD FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS. [END RECORDING]

   D'AUBUISSON SAID THAT ONCE THE MURDER OF THE SIX JESUITS HAS BEEN
CLEARED UP, U.S. AUTHORITIES HAVE NO REASON TO QUESTION THE
CONTINUATION OF U.S. ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO THE COUNTRY.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [D'AUBUISSON] THE JESUITS' CASE WAS A DETERMINING
FACTOR.  BUT NOW THAT THE CASE HAS BEEN FULLY SOLVED WITH THE HELP OF
THE FBI, SCOTLAND YARD, AND INVESTIGATORS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES, THIS
IS NO LONGER A PROBLEM, ALTHOUGH PREVIOUSLY IT WAS SERIOUS.  I DO NOT
BELIEVE THERE CAN BE ANY DOUBT NOW ABOUT RECEIVING THE AID, ESPECIALLY
AFTER THE TREMENDOUS OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT].  FOR ARGUMENT'S SAKE, IF THE SITUATION DID
ARISE [WHEREBY AID WAS SUSPENDED], THIS WOULD ONLY FAVOR THE FMLN.  I
KNOW THE FMLN HAS A WHOLE RANGE OF SUPPORT GROUPS THAT HANDLE
DISINFORMATION AND MAKE IT APPEAR AS IF THINGS HERE WERE DISASTROUS.
FOR EXAMPLE, INFORMATION ABROAD IS THAT THE AIR FORCE LEVELED ALL THE
NEIGHBORHOODS.  WE SALVADORANS KNOW THAT THE AIR FORCE WAS EXCESSIVELY
CAUTIOUS AND DID AN EXCELLENT JOB REPELLING THIS ATTACK WITH A MINIMUM
OF CIVILIANS WOUNDED.  FOR THAT MATTER, IF WE ARE GOING TO COMPARE
THINGS, U.S. MILITARY OPERATIONS IN PANAMA WERE MORE CLUMSY -- THERE
THEY SET A WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD ON FIRE. [END RECORDING]

   THE ARENA LEADER ALSO DENIED THAT THERE WERE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN
PRESIDENT CRISTIANI AND HIMSELF.  ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL PRESS
AGENCIES, THE DECISION OF THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT TO PROSECUTE THE
MILITARY MEN INVOLVED IN THE JESUITS' MURDER CAUSED DIVISION WITHIN
THE PARTY.  D'AUBUISSON DENIED THIS WAS TRUE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [D'AUBUISSON] NOT IN THE LEAST.  THERE HAVE NEVER
BEEN ANY DIFFERENCES WITH PRESIDENT CRISTIANI.  ON THE CONTRARY, WE
ARE VERY CLOSE AND GRATEFUL FOR THE GREAT EFFORT, WORK, AND THE
MAGNIFICENT JOB PRESIDENT CRISTIANI IS DOING.  THIS IS REASON FOR
PRIDE NOT ONLY AMONG FRIENDS OF PRESIDENT CRISTIANI BUT FOR THE PARTY
AND FRIENDS OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT. [END RECORDING]

   IN COMMENTING ON THE DIALOGUE WITH THE FMLN, D'AUBUISSON SUPPORTED
PRESIDENT CRITIANI'S INITIATIVE OF ENGAGING THE ASSISTANCE OF THE UN
SECRETARY GENERAL.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [D'AUBUISSON] I DO NOT THINK HE HAS THE TIME TO
ACT AS MEDIATOR; HOWEVER, HE COULD ACT AS A GUARANTOR, RECEIVING
RESULTS OF THESE TALKS AND ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH THE COMMITMENTS
MADE. [END RECORDING]

   MAJ ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON, CURRENTLY AN ARENA DEPUTY, SAID THAT THIS
YEAR HE WILL DEDICATE HIS TIME TO EXPAND AND REORGANIZE THE PARTY TO
GET READY FOR THE 1991 MUNICIPAL AND PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  HE WILL
MOST LIKELY NOT BE AN ARENA DEPUTY IN THE NEXT LEGISLATIVE PERIOD,
BECAUSE HE, ALONG WITH OTHER FORMER LEGISLATORS, WILL CONCENTRATE
THEIR POLITICAL ACTIVITIES ON THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PARLIAMENT.

   SAN SALVADOR, 3 DEC 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] TODAY THE SALVADORAN
DEFENSE MINISTRY FLATLY DENIED CHARGES RAISED YESTERDAY BY AN ALLEGED
"JUNIOR OFFICERS' COMMAND" THAT BLAMES CERTAIN OFFICERS OF THE ARMED
FORCES FOR THE MURDER OF THE SIX JESUITS.

   IN A COMMUNIQUE RELEASED TODAY, THE DEFENSE MINISTRY CATEGORICALLY
REJECTED "ALL TYPES OF SLANDER AND CHARGES AGAINST ITS MEMBERS,"
REFERRING TO THE ABOVEMENTIONED DOCUMENT THAT IT SAID "LACKS ALL LOGIC
AND CREDIBILITY."

   THE OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE POINTED OUT THAT "IN THESE MOMENTS, THE
ARMED FORCES ARE UNITED MORE THAN EVER BEFORE IN THE DEFENSE OF THE
FATHERLAND," ADDING THAT THE DOCUMENT ANONYMOUSLY DISTRIBUTED
YESTERDAY TO THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS IS "GREY PROPAGANDA."

   IN THE FOUR-PAGE DOCUMENT, A SO-CALLED "JUNIOR OFFICERS' COMMAND"
STATES THAT "COLONEL HECTOR HERIBERTO HERNANDEZ, CHIEF OF THE TREASURY
POLICE, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE (JESUITS') MURDERS."

   THE AUTHORS OF THE COMMUNIQUE ADD THAT THE "TROOPS FROM THAT
SECURITY CORPS LED BY CAPTAIN ALONSO CHAVEZ GARCIA" CARRIED OUT THE
EXECUTIONS," BUT IT DID NOT PROVIDE ANY DETAILS TO BACK UP THE
ACCUSATIONS.

   THE SIX JESUITS AND TWO MORE PERSONS WERE KILLED ON 16 NOVEMBER,
SHOT DURING THE NIGHT BY A GROUP OF ARMED INDIVIDUALS WEARING MILITARY
UNIFORMS, ACCORDING TO WITNESSES OF THE CRIME.

   THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT HAS INITIATED AN INVESTIGATION, INVITING
FOREIGN EXPERTS TO PARTICIPATE.

   THE OFFICIAL DEFENSE MINISTRY NOTE WARNED THAT "THE FORCE THAT
MAINTAINS THIS SOLID UNITY (OF THE ARMED FORCES) IS THE BLOOD SHED BY
OUR SOLDIERS TO DEFEND THE FATHERLAND AND OUR IDEAS, CUSTOMS,
RELIGION, DEMOCRACY, AND FREEDOM."

   THE MINISTRY'S COMMUNIQUE URGES THE CITIZENS "NOT TO ALLOW
THEMSELVES TO BE DECEIVED BY THE AMOUNT OF RUMORS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL
PRESSURES THAT THE MARXIST BOOKS OF THEORY CLEARLY DEFINE AS A FORM OF
STRUGGLE TO ACHIEVE POWER."

   THE COMMUNIQUE ALSO DISCLOSES THAT FORMER CAPTAIN MAURICIO MENA
SANDOVAL, WHO JOINED THE GUERRILLAS IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES, HAS MADE
TELEPHONE CALLS OR SENT "PERSONAL NOTES" TO CHIEFS OR OFFICERS.

   "THESE CRIMINAL TERRORISTS RESORT TO THIS TYPE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL
TACTICS WHEN THEY FEEL THEY ARE LOST OR DESPERATE," THE COMMUNIQUE
ADDS, REFERRING TO THE FAILURE OF THE OFFENSIVE THAT THE GUERRILLAS
LAUNCHED ON 11 NOVEMBER.

   PANAMA CITY (PANAMA), 16 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] PANAMA'S
ARCHBISHOP MARCOS MCGRATH, PANAMA'S EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE PRESIDENT
JOSE LUIS LACUNZA, AND PANAMANIAN ABDIEL ADAMES, PRESIDENT OF THE
CENTRAL AMERICAN HIGHER UNIVERSITY COUNCIL (CSUCA), HAVE CONDEMNED THE
ASSASSINATION OF SIX JESUITS IN EL SALVADOR AT DAWN TODAY.

   MCGRATH, WHO DESCRIBED THE MULTIPLE ASSASSINATION AS "MONSTROUS,"
POINTED OUT THAT "IT IS EVERYBODY'S DUTY, ESPECIALLY OF THAT COUNTRY'S
GOVERNMENT, TO IDENTIFY, ARREST, AND TRY THE CULPRITS AND THOSE WHO
ORDERED THE ACTION."

   THIS "MUST NOT ONLY BE A JUST TRIAL OF THEM, BUT ALSO A MEANS TO
ELOQUENTLY EXPRESS THE REJECTION OF THE ENTIRE SOCIETY, WHICH CALLS
ITSELF CHRISTIAN, AGAINST SUCH A CRUEL AND UNJUST CRIME THAT REVEALS
ABSOLUTE CONTEMPT FOR HUMAN LIFE," A COMMUNIQUE SIGNED BY ARCHBISHOP
MCGRATH STATES.

   ACCORDING TO SOURCES FROM EL SALVADOR'S JESUIT CURIA, THE SPANISH
JESUIT IGNACIO ELLACURIA, RECTOR OF EL SALVADOR'S CENTRAL AMERICAN
UNIVERSITY (UCA), FIVE OTHER PRIESTS, AND TWO SALVADORAN WOMEN WERE
MURDERED AT DAWN TODAY BY MEN WEARING MILITARY UNIFORMS.

   IN THE OPINION OF SPANISH BISHOP JOSE LUIS LACUNZA, SECRETARY OF
PANAMA'S EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE AND RECTOR OF SANTA MARIA LA ANTIGUA
UNIVERSITY, "THESE ASSASSINATIONS WERE PERPETRATED WITH MALICE AND IN
COLD BLOOD."  "THEY ARE CERTAINLY TO BE CONDEMNED, REGARDLESS OF WHO
CARRIED THEM OUT," HE ADDED.

   CSUCA PRESIDENT PANAMANIAN ABDIEL ADAMES DESCRIBED AS "ABOMINABLE"
AND "REPREHENSIBLE" THE ASSASSINATION OF SIX PRIESTS AND TWO WOMEN.

   ADAMES, WHO IS ALSO RECTOR OF PANAMA'S NATIONAL UNIVERSITY,
REJECTED THE ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE "AS A MEANS TO REACH AGREEMENTS IN
EL SALVADOR, ESPECIALLY NOW THAT PRIESTS HAVE BEEN KILLED."

   CSUCA WILL ASK THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT TO DECLARE UCA A
"SANCTUARY" OR "NEUTRAL ZONE" TO TREAT THOSE WOUNDED IN THE CLASHES
BETWEEN THE ARMY AND GUERRILLAS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE SINCE 11
NOVEMBER IN SAN SALVADOR AND OTHER TOWNS, ADAMES POINTED OUT.

   CSUCA COORDINATOR AND SALVADORAN GUILLERMO GALVAN SAID TODAY IN SAN
JOSE (COSTA RICA) THAT HE ASKED PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS TO "MEDIATE TO
BRING ABOUT A SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT AND STEP UP EFFORTS
TO PREVENT "MASSACRES" AND "SELECTIVE MURDERS."

   BOGOTA, 1 FEB 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] THE ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION
(ELN) HAS ANNOUNCED IN A COMMUNIQUE SENT TO ANTONIO ROLDAN BETANCUR,
GOVERNOR OF THE NORTHWESTERN ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT, THAT IT REJECTS THE
PEACE PLAN PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THAT IT WILL CONTINUE ARMED
ATTACKS, IT WAS LEARNED A FEW HOURS AGO.

   ACCORDING TO INITIAL REPORTS, THE ARMED MOVEMENT--THE MOST RADICAL
OF THE GUERRILLA GROUPS IN THE COUNTRY--SENT THE MESSAGE THROUGH LUIS
MESA PUERTA, A POLICE INSPECTOR OF EL TIGRE, WHO WAS KIDNAPED LAST
FRIDAY FOR THIS PURPOSE.

   ROLDAN BETANCUR DID NOT DISCLOSE ANY MORE DETAILS AND MERELY
CONFIRMED THAT THE CASTROITE ELN, WHICH HAS STAGED SEVERAL DYNAMITE
ATTACKS AGAINST OIL INSTALLATIONS, DID NOT ACCEPT THE PROPOSAL MADE BY
PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS' GOVERNMENT.

   MEANWHILE, THE M-19 SENT A LETTER A FEW HOURS AGO TO MISAEL
PASTRANA BORRERO, A FORMER PRESIDENT AND MEMBER OF THE OPPOSITION
SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE PARTY (PSC), REQUESTING THAT HIS PARTY ACTIVELY
PARTICIPATE IN A NEW PEACE INITIATIVE THAT FORMALLY BEGAN THE 2D WEEK
OF JANUARY.

   AT THAT TIME, ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT, RAFAEL PARDO RUEDA--THE
PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER FOR PEACE--AND THE TOP M-19 COMMANDER, CARLOS
PIZARRO LEON GOMEZ, SIGNED A PRELIMINARY AGREEMENT THAT CONTEMPLATES
THE BEGINNING OF A DIRECT DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GUERRILLA GROUPS AND
SPOKESMEN OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES REPRESENTED IN PARLIAMENT.

   HOWEVER, THE FARC, WHICH DECLARED A UNILATERAL TRUCE TO FACILIATE
THE BEGINNING OF THE CONVERSATIONS, SAID THAT THESE AGREEMENTS WERE
"EXCLUSIVE," AS THEY WERE SIGNED BY ONLY ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S REBEL
MOVEMENTS.

   THE DOCUMENT SIGNED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE M-19 SPECIFIES THAT
THE TASKS WITH ALL THE REBEL ORGANIZATIONS ARE CONDUCTED THROUGH THE
SIMON BOLIVAR NATIONAL GUERRILLA COORDINATING BOARD (CNGSB).  HOWEVER,
WITH THE ELN ANNOUNCEMENT, A JOINT AGREEMENT HAS BEEN RULED OUT.

   MEANWHILE, PRIOR TO LEAVING TODAY FOR CARACAS WHERE HE WILL ATTEND
THE INAUGURATION OF CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ, THE PRESIDENT HELD A MEETING
WITH THE CHIEFS OF THE TWO TRADITIONAL PARTIES, FORMER PRESIDENTS
JULIO CESAR TURBAY OF THE RULING LIBERAL PARTY, AND PASTRANA BORRERO,
OF THE PSC.

   THE MEETING HELD AT THE NARINO PALACE (SEAT OF THE GOVERNMENT) WAS
CALLED SO THAT BARCO VARGAS COULD REPORT TO THE PSC ON THE DEVELOPMENT
OF THE MOST RECENT EVENTS CONCERNING THE NEW PEACE PROCESS THAT BEGAN
WITH THE M-19.

   ACCORDING TO SOME POLITICAL CIRCLES, IN THIS MANNER THE PATH TOWARD
PEACE MIGHT BE CLEARED, INASMUCH AS ONE OF THE "RESERVATIONS" THE PSC
HAD WAS THAT THE BARCO VARGAS GOVERNMENT DID NOT CONSULT WITH THE
PARTIES ON THE NEGOTIATIONS.

SOME PEOPLE ARE APPARENTLY INTERPRETING IN TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT
THEY ARE SPANISH, OR SPANISH CITIZENS WHO TOOK ON SALVADORAN
CITIZENSHIP, BUT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT SOME OF THE CITIZENS WHO
SUFFERED THIS APPALLING ATTACK, THIS MURDER, WERE SPANISH.  OUR
CONCERN OBVIOUSLY IS NOT EXPRESSED MERELY IN TERMS OF THIS OR THAT
NATIONALITY BECAUSE THIS MURDER IS A HIDEOUS CRIME AND THUS THE MATTER
MUST BE CLEARED UP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, AND FURTHERMORE MUCH OF THE
EFFORT OF CONFIDENCE IN THE FUTURE OF [WORDS INDISTINCT] WITH REGARD

   BUENOS AIRES, 13 DEC 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] LAST NIGHT, A FEW HOURS
BEFORE THE CHILEAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, A VIOLENT EXPLOSION DAMAGED
THE WINDOWS AND FACING OF THE SALVADORAN CONSULATE IN SANTIAGO.  NO
ONE WAS INJURED.

   A FLAG FROM THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT (FPMR) WAS FOUND
AT THE SCENE OF THE EXPLOSION.  THE FPMR IS A CLANDESTINE LEFTIST
GROUP THAT PROMOTES "ALL FORMS OF STRUGGLE" AGAINST THE MILITARY
GOVERNMENT HEADED BY GENERAL AUGUSTO PINOCHET.

   POLICE SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THAT THE EXPLOSION CAUSED SERIOUS
DAMAGE TO THE SALVADORAN EMBASSY BUILDING AND TO NEARBY STRUCTURES IN
THE ELEGANT PROVIDENCIA NEIGHORHOOD IN EASTERN SANTIAGO.

   THE GOVERNMENT CHARGES THAT THE FPMR, WHICH ON 14 DECEMBER WILL
MARK 6 YEARS OF SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITY, IS THE "ARMED BRANCH" OF THE
OUTLAWED COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHILE.  AS OF MIDNIGHT TONIGHT THE
CARABINEROS AND POLICE AND SECURITY SERVICE AGENTS WERE CARRYING OUT
AN INTENSIVE OPERATION TO ARREST THOSE RESPONISBLE FOR THE ATTACK.

   NO CITY, NO DATE -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH PERUVIAN PRESIDENT GARCIA
BY AMAT AND AN UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [AMAT] MR.
PRESIDENT, WHEN ONE SEES PERU FACING THE DIFFICULTIES IT IS
EXPERIENCING NOW, THE SAME AS OUR OWN COUNTRY AND LATIN AMERICA IN
GENERAL, ONE ASKS HIMSELF: WOULD A MAN, A NOVELIST LIKE MARIO VARGAS
LLOSA, BE THE RIGHT MAN TO LEAD PERU?

   [GARCIA] AS PRESIDENT OF ALL PERUVIANS -- AND OF VARGAS LLOSA TO
EVEN IF HE DOES NOT LIKE IT -- I CANNOT PASS JUDGMENT, EITHER
ETHICALLY OR INTELLECTUALLY, ON A POLITICIAN AND PERUVIAN WHO IS
CONTENDING FOR THE PRESIDENCY.

   [REPORTER] WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO AFTER YOU STEP DOWN FROM THE
PRESIDENCY?

   [GARCIA] WELL, I AM GOING TO BE FREE.

   [AMAT] WHY DO YOU NOT COME TO COLOMBIA AND I AM SURE...

   [GARCIA, INTERRUPTING] SURE, I ACCEPT YOUR INVITATION, AND I HOPE
SOME COLOMBIANS WILL EXTEND IT.  HOWEVER, I WANT TO TELL YOU VERY
HONESTLY, THAT I AM PERHAPS BETTER AT SELLING DREAMS, IDEAS, AND
DOCTRINES THAN AT ADMINISTERING A SITUATION OF PENURY, LIKE THE ONE
OUR COUNTRIES ARE EXPERIENCING, AND MOST PARTICULARLY PERU, WHICH IS
ONE OF THE POOREST COUNTRIES IN LATIN AMERICA.  IT IS VERY DIFFICULT.
FOR INSTANCE, ON A DAY WHEN THE PRICE OF RICE OR CHICKEN GOES UP, THE
PEOPLE WILL NOT BELIEVE YOU, EVEN IF YOU TELL THEM THE GREATEST OF
TRUTHS.  ONE CAN BE PREACHING SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT, BUT IF IT
FAILED TO RAIN AND THE CITY HAD NO WATER NO ONE WILL BELIEVE OF YOU
THE GREATEST OF ALL TRUTHS.  THEN, WHEN ONE STOPS BEING PRESIDENT AND
ADMINISTERING PENURY, ONE CAN DEVOTE ONESELF TO CONVINCING PEOPLE, TO
EDUCATING.  THAT IS WHAT I SHOULD DO.

   [AMAT] NOW, WHY DID YOU MAKE THAT ASIDE, MAKING ME PRESIDENT OF ALL
PERUVIANS, EVEN OF VARGAS LLOSA?  WHETHER HE LIKES OR NOT IT HURTS
HIM.

   [GARCIA] BECAUSE I AM SURE THAT SOME PEOPLE WOULD NOT LIKE TO HAVE
ME AS PRESIDENT.  [LAUGHTER]

   [AMAT] EVEN HIM, FOR INSTANCE?

   [GARCIA] I DID NOT SAY SO.  I DO NOT KNOW.  I NEVER FALL TO THE
LEVEL OF DEFINING PEOPLE OR POINTING OUT LAST NAMES.  I MAKE AN
OUTLINE OR DEFINE THEM IN THE NEGATIVE.

   [AMAT] MR. PRESIDENT, [WORDS INDISTINCT] THIS DIALOGUE [WORDS
INDISTINCT] FOR YOUR GENEROSITY AND KINDNESS.  ADDRESSING OUR PEOPLE
AND OUR COUNTRY, [WORDS INDISTINCT], HOW WERE THINGS TODAY AT THE
SUMMIT?

   [GARCIA] VERY WELL.  COLOMBIANS, WHO HAVE SEEN THEIR INSTITUTION
THREATENED, THEIR PRESS ABUSED, AND MANY POLITICIANS ALSO THREATENED,
MUST HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT LATIN AMERICA, TOGETHER WITH THE UNITED
STATES, WILL CONFRONT THE PROBLEM OF DRUG TRAFFICKING.  THIS IS NOT
ONLY A PROBLEM FOR COLOMBIA.  IT IS OUR PROBLEM TOO, AND WE WILL
TACKLE IT.  THE DAY A NEWSPAPER WAS BLOWN UP IN BOGOTA I CAME TO
BOGOTA BECAUSE I FELT THAT FREEDOM OF THE PRESS WAS THREATENED ON THE
CONTINENT.  AFTER ALL, WE ARE LATIN AMERICANS.  LET COLOMBIANS HAVE
CONFIDENCE.

   SAN SALVADOR, 26 JUN 89 (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY MILTON GRIMALDI] [TEXT]
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI SAID TODAY THAT DESPITE THE FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT'S [FMLN] TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST
SALVADORANS, HIS GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO HOLD TALKS WITH THE REBELS.
HE SAID THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION IS CONTINUING ITS EFFORTS TO FORM A
COMMISSION FOR A DIALOGUE WITH THE REBELS AND THAT HE IS NOW AWAITING
WORD FROM TWO PEOPLE WHOM HE HAS CHOSEN TO SERVE ON THE COMMISSION.
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WILL NOT BE REPRESENTED ON THE COMMISSION BECAUSE
THE COMMISSION IS COMPLETELY POLITICAL IN NATURE.  PRESIDENT CRISTIANI
CONDEMNED THE MURDER OF NATIONAL FIRE DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR COLONEL
ROBERTO ARMANDO RIVERA ESCOBAR, WHO WAS KILLED IN A MACHINEGUN ATTACK
THIS MORNING.  PRESIDENT CRISTIANI ATTRIBUTED RIVERA'S MURDER TO THE
FMLN:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] IT IS CLEAR THAT THE FMLN DOES NOT
WANT PEACE BUT INSTEAD WANTS TO CONTINUE THE VIOLENCE.  THE FMLN
COMMITTED THIS CRIME.  I BELIEVE THAT A TREACHEROUS CRIME SUCH AS THIS
ONE CANNOT BE CALLED ANYTHING BUT A COWARDLY ACT.  WE WILL, OF COURSE,
INVESTIGATE THE CRIME.  I REPEAT, HOWEVER, THAT ALL THE EVIDENCE WE
HAVE GATHERED ON THE FMLN'S PLANS INDICATE THAT IT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR
THIS ACTION.

   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO PREPARE THE
COMMISSION THAT IS TO HOLD TALKS [WORDS INDISTINCT]?

   [CRISTIANI] THE TERRORISTS WILL NOT OF COURSE BE SUCCESSFUL WITH
ACTIONS OF THIS KIND AND WILL NOT PROVOKE US INTO VIOLENT ACTION.
THEY SHOULD UNDERSTAND BY NOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS SEARCHING FOR
PEACE AND WANTS TO ACHIEVE PEACE WITHIN EL SALVADOR'S LEGAL FRAMEWORK
AND BY APPLYING THE LAW.  THE FMLN REBELS SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR
TERRORIST ACTIONS WILL NOT LEAD US TO TAKE RASH ACTIONS; IT IS USELESS
FOR THEM TO CONTINUE TO ACT IN THIS WAY.

   WE ARE CONTINUING OUR WORK ON SETTING UP THE COMMISSION.  TODAY WE
WILL SPEAK WITH TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE STILL NOT TOLD US IF THEY WILL
ACCEPT MY INVITATION TO BE COMMISSION MEMBERS.  THE NAMES OF THE
COMMISSION MEMBERS WILL BE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC ONCE THE COMMISSION
IS FULLY FORMED.

   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE CATHOLIC CHURCH'S ROLE IN THIS
COMMISSION?

   [CRISTIANI] [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WILL NOT BE
REPRESENTED IN THIS COMMISSION BECAUSE IT IS A POLITICAL COMMISSION
AND NOT ONE IN WHICH THE CHURCH CAN EFFECTIVELY PARTICIPATE.  THE
CHURCH HAS ALWAYS WORKED FOR PEACE AND HAS MADE ALL POSSIBLE EFFORTS
TO FIND PEACE FOR THE COUNTRY THE CHURCH WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARD
THIS GOAL.  HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THAT THE CHURCH HAS A DIFFERENT ROLE TO
PLAY IN THE SEARCH FOR PEACE, AND THAT ROLE IS NOT SERVING ON THE
POLITICAL COMMISSION.

   [REPORTER] WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IS THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE YOU HAVE
ENCOUNTERED IN THE MONTH THAT YOU HAVE SERVED AS PRESIDENT?

   [CRISTIANI] I BELIEVE THAT THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE HAS BEEN OUR
INABILITY TO LAUNCH OUR GOVERNMENT PROGRAM, WHICH IS DUE TO THE STATE
OF AFFAIRS EXISTING IN THE FORMER ADMINISTRATION WHEN WE TOOK OVER. WE
HAVE REPEATEDLY OBSERVED THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS IN THE MAJORITY OF
GOVERNMENT [WORD INDISTINCT].  THROUGHOUT GOVERNMENT OFFICES, DISORDER
WAS RAMPANT, AND, IN MANY CASES, WE HAVE OBSERVED THAT GOVERNMENT
OFFICES WERE MANAGED IRRESPONSIBLY.  MOREOVER, THE NATION'S PUBLIC
FINANCES HAVE GREATLY DETERIORATED.  WE HAVE INHERITED A COUNTRY IN
VERY BAD FINANCIAL SHAPE, AND, I BELIEVE, THIS HAS DELAYED THE
LAUNCHING OF OUR GOVERNMENT PROGRAM. [END RECORDING]

   CRISTIANI, REFERRING TO COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS' OFFER TO
HOLD A DIALOGUE WITH THE REBELS IN COSTA RICAN TERRITORY, SAID THAT
THE OFFER WAS A GREAT CONTRIBUTION TOWARD CONVINCING THE FMLN TO STOP
MURDERING DEFENSELESS CITIZENS.

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 27 NOV 89 (RADIO SANDINO) -- [TEXT] TODAY
RESCUE TEAMS, ARMY TROOPS, AND POLICE HAD THE SORRY TASK OF RECOVERING
107 DISFIGURED BODIES OF THE VICTIMS OF AVIANCA'S BOEING 727 THAT
EXPLODED IN MIDAIR IN A SPARSELY POPULATED REGION NEAR BOGOTA.
ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL SPOKESMEN, THE TASK IS MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE
THE BODIES WERE SCATTERED OVER A RADIUS OF 8 KM.  THE PLANE DEPARTED
BOGOTA TOWARD CALI, AT 1213 GMT, BUT TWO POWERFUL EXPLOSION BROUGHT IT
DOWN AFTER ONLY 5 MINUTES IN THE AIR.  BOMB-SQUAD EXPERTS, IN
COORDINATION WITH THREE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATORS, HAVE STARTED TO
EXAMINE THE SITE TO INVESTIGATE THE ACCIDENT AND DETERMINE WHETHER THE
TRAGEDY WAS CAUSED BY A MECHANICAL FAILURE, OR IF IT WAS A TERRORIST
ACTION.  THE BOGOTA CARACOL NETWORK RECEIVED AN ANONYMOUS CALL FROM
THE EXTRADITABLES -- COLOMBIAN DRUG KINGPINS WANTED BY SEVERAL U.S.
FEDERAL COURTS -- WHO SAID THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTION.
ANOTHER NETWORK REPORTS THAT THE MAN WHO CALLED THE CARACOL NETWORK
NEWS OFFICE SAID HE BELONGED TO THE EXTRADITABLES AND THAT THE ACTION
WAS CARRIED OUT BECAUSE THERE WERE FIVE INFORMERS ON THE PLANE.  THE
POLICE HAVE REPORTED THAT THEY ARE INVESTIGATING THE EXPLOSIONS THAT
CAUSED THE PLANE TO CRASH SHORTLY AFTER IT LEFT THE BOGOTA EL DORADO
AIRPORT TO GO TO CALI.

   SAN JOSE (COSTA RICA), 18 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE
GUATEMALAN GUERRILLA MOVEMENT TODAY ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL MAKE THE
GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO AND THE GUATEMALAN ARMY "PAY
DEARLY" FOR HAVING "INTERVENED" IN THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT.

   A COMMUNIQUE BY THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY (URNG),
RELEASED IN COSTA RICA, STRESSED THAT 126 ELITE TROOPS OF THE
GUATEMALAN ARMY, KNOWN AS KAIBILES, ARE COLLABORATING WITH SALVADORAN
SOLDIERS TO PUT AN END TO THE OFFENSIVE BY GUERRILLAS OF THE FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN).

   THE URNG CHARGE, ALSO PRESENTED BY THE FMLN, HAS BEEN CATEGORICALLY
AND REPEATEDLY DENIED BY GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT SPOKESWOMAN CLAUDIA
ARENAS.

   THE REBEL COMMUNIQUE STATED: "WE VIGOROUSLY CONDEMN THE
INTERVENTION OF THE GUATEMALAN ARMY AGAINST THE GLORIOUS SALVADORAN
PEOPLE.  WE WILL MAKE THE GUATEMALAN ARMY AND GOVERNMENT PAY DEARLY
FOR THIS AGGRESSION."

   THE NOTE WAS RELEASED SHORTLY AFTER SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI ANNOUNCED THE VICTORY OF HIS COUNTRY'S ARMY OVER THE FMLN,
FOLLOWING FIERCE FIGHTING THAT LEFT APPROXIMATELY 1,000 DEAD AND MORE
THAN 1,500 WOUNDED IN THE PAST 7 DAYS.

   IN ADDITION, THE GUATEMALAN GUERRILLAS EXPRESSED SOLIDARITY "WITH
THE COMMUNITY OF JESUIT PRIESTS" AND THEIR SORROW BECAUSE OF THE
KILLING OF SIX OF THEIR MEMBERS, INCLUDING CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY
RECTOR IGNACIO ELLACURIA AND TWO WOMEN, CARRIED OUT BY UNIFORMED MEN
IN SAN SALVADOR ON 16 NOVEMBER.

   THE URNG DECLARATION IS SIGNED BY COMMANDERS ROLANDO MORAN, GASPAR
ILOM, AND PABLO MONSANTO.

   SAN SALVADOR, 28 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] FRANCISCO
MERINO, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND INTERIOR MINISTER, HAS
STRONGLY CONDEMNED THE MURDER OF FORMER SUPREME COURT PRESIDENT
FRANCISCO JOSE GUERRERO.  MERINO DESCRIBED THE CULPRITS AS MURDEROUS
BEASTS.

   THE VICE PRESIDENT WENT TO THE MEDICAL-SURGICAL HOSPITAL OF THE
SALVADORAN INSTITUTE OF SOCIAL SECURITY, TO WHICH DR GUERRERO WAS
TAKEN AFTER THE ATTACK.  GUERRERO, WHO WAS AN ADVISER TO THE
GOVERNMENTAL COMMISSION FOR SUPPORT TO THE DIALOGUE [COMISION DE APOYO
GUBERNAMENTAL DE DIALOGO], WAS SHOT TO DEATH BY TERRORISTS AT THE
INTERSECTION OF BOULEVARD DE LOS HEROES AND ALAMEDA JUAN PABLO II.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] WHAT THEY ARE SHOWING IS THAT THEY ARE
BENT ON CARRYING OUT TOTALLY DESTRUCTIVE ACTIONS TO LOWER THE
CONFIDENCE OF THE POPULATION AND TO PROVOKE GENERAL PANIC.  I THINK
THAT ALTHOUGH AS A GOVERNMENT WE HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED A CONCILIATORY
POSITION TO ATTAIN PEACE IN EL SALVADOR, WE MUST ALSO MAKE A FIRMER
DECISION TO TAKE STRONGER ACTION.  THE PEOPLE WHO COMMIT THESE WANTON
ACTIONS ARE DERANGED PEOPLE.  THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND WORDS.  THEY DO
NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THEY MUST RESPECT A LEGAL SYSTEM, OR A DEMOCRATIC
PROCESS OR ONE OF HUMANIZATION.  THEY ARE SIMPLY BEASTS AND MURDERERS
AND MUST BE TREATED AS SUCH.  [END RECORDING]

   MERINO SAID THE MURDERERS MUST BE PUNISHED WITH THE FULL WEIGHT OF
THE LAWS, AND THAT ONE OF THE TERRORISTS WHO WAS WOUNDED AND CAPTURED
AT THE SITE OF THE CRIME IS UNDER INTERROGATION.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] ONE OF THE CRIMINALS WAS WOUNDED.  THIS
WILL OBVIOUSLY ENABLE US TO OBTAIN SOME CLUES AS TO THE IDENTITY OF
THE ACTUAL KILLERS AND OF THE MASTERMINDS OF THIS NEW MURDER, WHICH
HAS SHOCKED SALVADORAN SOCIETY.

   AS IN PREVIOUS CASES, WE ARE CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS IN THIS
CASE.  HOWEVER, I REPEAT THAT THE TIME HAS COME FOR US TO TAKE A
FIRMER STAND, TO DO OUR UTMOST, AND TO REALIZE THAT IF NOTHING HAS
HAPPENED TO US THUS FAR, IT DOES NOT MEAN WE WILL NOT FALL VICTIM TO
THESE MURDERERS.  IT IS BETTER TO TAKE PRECAUTIONS NOW THAN TO HAVE
REGRETS LATER.  [END RECORDING]

   MERINO SAID THAT THIS CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE PROMOTED BY THE
TERRORIST HORDES HAS NOT ENDED.  CLEAR EVIDENCE OF THIS IS THIS BRUTAL
AND COWARDLY MURDER, WHICH HAS AGAIN FILLED THE SUFFERING SALVADORAN
PEOPLE WITH SORROW.

PRESIDENT DIEGO MONTANA CUELLAR.

   2.  TO RESPOND TO SUCH PROPOSALS, WE REITERATE OUR WELL-KNOWN PEACE
COMMITMENTS EXPRESSED IN OUR MOST SINCERE AND FRANK STATEMENTS.

   3.  WE FULLY SHARE THE CRITERIA EXPRESSED BY THEM REGARDING THE
SURVIVAL OF THE STATE AND GOVERNMENT, WHICH WAS DEMOCRATICALLY
ELECTED, AGAINST ORGANIZATIONS AND PEOPLE LIKE US, WHO HAVE SHOWN NO
REGARD FOR THE LAW BY FIGHTING INSTITUTIONS AND THE LEGALLY
ESTABLISHED ORDER.

   4.  AFTER EVALUATING OUR CONDUCT UNDER THE PREVIOUS CONCEPT, WE ARE
ONLY INTERESTED IN PEACE, TRANQUILLITY, AND DEMOCRACY FOR OUR
FATHERLAND AND FOR OUR PEOPLE.

INSTITUTIONS, AND THE LEGALLY ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT.  WE WILL LAY

COUNTRY'S BEST INTERESTS.

   6.  WE ACCEPT THE LEGAL ORDER THAT IS CURRENTLY IN FORCE WITH THE
HOPE THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND SOCIETY WILL RESPECT OUR RIGHTS AND WILL
ALLOW US TO RETURN TO OUR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES.

   7.  AS AN ABSOLUTE PROOF OF OUR INTEREST IN ACHIEVING PEACE, WE
HAVE DECIDED TO IMMEDIATELY RELEASE MRS PATRICIA ECHAVARRIA AND HER
DAUGHTER AS WELL AS OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING HELD HOSTAGE AS
CIRCUMSTANCES PERMIT.  WE WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT WE ARE NOT
RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE CASES OF KIDNAPPED PEOPLE OF WHICH WE ARE
ACCUSED.

   8.  WE OFFER OUR SERVICES AS MEDIATORS TO ACHIEVE PEACE WITH THE
EMERALD TRAFFICKERS, THE SO-CALLED PARAMILITARY GROUPS, AND THE
SO-CALLED HIRED ASSASSINS WITH THE ONLY PURPOSE OF ENDING THE VIOLENCE
THAT IS HURTING OUR COLOMBIAN FATHERLAND.

   9.  WE HAVE DECIDED TO SUSPEND THE SHIPMENT OF DRUGS AND TO TURN IN
OUR WEAPONS, EXPLOSIVES, LABORATORIES, CLANDESTINE LANDING STRIPS, AND
OTHER ELEMENTS THAT ARE RELATED TO OUR ACTIVITIES AS SOON AS WE GET
CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL GUARANTEES.

   10.  THERE WILL BE NO MORE BOMBINGS ANYWHERE ON NATIONAL TERRITORY
AND WE HAVE ORDERED THE SUSPENSION OF ALL TYPES OF EXECUTIONS OF
POLITICAL LEADERS, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, ASSOCIATION LEADERS, JUDICIAL
OFFICIALS, JOURNALISTS, POLICEMEN, AND SOLDIERS.

   11.  THE ESSENTIAL REASON FOR OUR STRUGGLE HAS BEEN AND WILL ALWAYS
BE OUR FAMILIES, OUR FREEDOM, OUR PEOPLE, OUR LIVES, AND OUR RIGHTS AS
CITIZENS OF THIS FATHERLAND.

ARTURO CASADIEGO TORRADO, SECOND IN COMMAND OF THE COLOMBIAN POLICE,
HAS REPORTED THE DEATH OF GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA.  [POLICE DIRECTOR]
GENERAL GOMEZ PADILLA, WHO IS IN CALI, WILL TRAVEL TO BOGOTA AND WILL
SOON HOLD A NEWS CONFERENCE TO PROVIDE MORE DETAILS ON THE DEATH OF
THIS CRIMINAL.

   IN AN INTERVIEW, GEN CASADIEGO TORRADO INFORMED RCN OF THE
OPERATION MOUNTED IN THE AREA WHERE THE INCIDENT OCCURRED.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CASADIEGO] WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED BY THOSE
OPERATING IN THAT AREA THAT RODRIGUEZ GACHA, HIS SON, AND THE PEOPLE
WITH THEM HAVE BEEN KILLED.

   THAT IS THE INFORMATION WE HAVE AVAILABLE.  WE DO NOT HAVE DETAILS
ON THE OPERATION YET.  IT WAS THE RESULT OF LONG-TERM INTELLIGENCE
WORK CARRIED OUT WITH GREAT PROFESSIONALISM, WHICH GAVE US INFORMATION
ON WHERE HE COULD BE FOUND.  WE DEPLOYED SPECIAL GROUPS TO CARRY OUT
THAT TASK.

   [REPORTER] GENERAL, EXACTLY WHERE DID THE OPERATION, IN WHICH
RODRIGUEZ GACHA, HIS SON, AND 15 OTHERS WERE KILLED, TAKE PLACE?

   [CASADIEGO] IN A RURAL AREA, AS YOU KNOW, IN THE NORTHERN PART OF
THE COUNTRY.  I DO NOT KNOW THE EXACT LOCATION.

   [REPORTER] HAS IT BEEN OFFICIALLY REPORTED THAT RODRIGUEZ GACHA AND
HIS SON WERE KILLED?  IS THIS AN OFFICIAL REPORT FROM THE NATIONAL
POLICE?

   [CASADIEGO] THAT IS THE INFORMATION I HAVE.  THAT IS THE
INFORMATION I HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE SCENE OF THE INCIDENT.

   [REPORTER] WHO ARE THE OTHER 15 PEOPLE KILLED?

   [CASADIEGO] WE HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED THEM YET.  OFFICIALS ARE
TRAVELING TO THE SITE TO OFFICIALLY IDENTIFY THE BODIES.

   [REPORTER] WERE THEY ASSISTANTS, BODYGUARDS, ESCORTS?

   [CASADIEGO] YES, WE ARE SURE OF THAT.

   [REPORTER] HAVE WEAPONS OR OTHER ITEMS BEEN CONFISCATED?  WE HAVE
HEARD THAT IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS WERE FOUND.

   [CASADIEGO] YES, WE KNOW THAT WEAPONS WERE FOUND WHICH WERE USED TO
PROTECT THIS MAN.  HOWEVER, AS I SAID, WE DO NOT HAVE THE DETAILS ON
THE INCIDENT YET.  WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT RODRIGUEZ GACHA AND HIS SON
WERE KILLED, AS WELL AS OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE WITH HIM.

   [REPORTER] WHO ELSE IS THERE?  IS THERE A COMMISSION OF JUDGES?  WE
UNDERSTAND THAT A FEW MOMENTS AGO A PLANE DEPARTED WITH
REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE DIRECTORATE AND THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE.

   [CASADIEGO] I DO NOT KNOW IF REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE CRIMINAL
INVESTIGATIVE DIRECTORATE HAVE TRAVELED THERE.  WE SENT POLICE
INSPECTORS, JUDGES, AND WE KNOW THAT THE COMMANDERS OF THE THREE
NEIGHBORING DEPARTMENTS WILL ALSO BE THERE.

   [REPORTER] HOW WAS THE OPERATION PLANNED, AND HAS THE PRESIDENT
BEEN INFORMED?

   [CASADIEGO] AS I SAID, THIS OPERATION IS THE RESULT OF ARDUOUS WORK
BY THE NATIONAL POLICE.  IT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT MISSION.  FOR A LONG
TIME WE HAVE BEEN CARRYING OUT THESE TYPES OF OPERATIONS.  WE ARE
STILL DOING THIS TYPE OF WORK AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO.  [CONTINUED]

   CARACAS (VENEZUELA), 27 OCT 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] THE ATTACK IN WHICH
FIVE VENEZUELAN SOLDIERS WERE KILLED AT THE BORDER WITH COLOMBIA HAS
BEEN BLAMED, ACCORDING TO SOME REPORTS, ON COLOMBIAN GUERRILLAS AND
DRUG TRAFFICKING GANGS OPERATING IN COLOMBIA.

   VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ BLAMED COLOMBIAN DRUG
TRAFFICKING GANGS FOR THE ATTACK -- IN WHICH FIVE GUARDS WERE KILLED
-- PERPETRATED ON 26 OCTOBER IN THE BORDER STATE OF APURE AGAINST A
NATIONAL GUARD PATROL IN THE AREA.

   REFERRING LAST NIGHT TO THE DRUG TRAFFICKING GANGS, PEREZ SAID THIS
IS "A PROVOCATION FOR VENEZUELA BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING TO EXTEND
THEIR CLAWS TO OUR COUNTRY."

   HOWEVER, JORGE ROMERO, GOVERNOR OF THE BORDER STATE OF TACHIRA,
WHICH BORDERS THE STATE OF APURE, MAINTAINED THIS WAS AN "ATTACK WITH
VERY POWERFUL EXPLOSIVES" PERPETRATED BY "MEMBERS OF THE COLOMBIAN
GUERRILLAS, PRESUMABLY FROM THE ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY,
AGAINST A NATIONAL GUARD JEEP."

   ACCORDING TO ROMERO, IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED DURING THE PRELIMINARY
INVESTIGATIONS THAT THE EXPLOSIVES THAT KILLED THE FIVE SOLDIERS WERE
BURIED IN A ROAD NEAR CUTUFI, AND SET OFF BY REMOTE CONTROL AS THE
MILITARY VEHICLE PASSED BY.

   LAST NIGHT, THE DEFENSE MINISTRY ORDERED THE ARREST OF FIVE ALLEGED
COLOMBIAN GUERRILLAS, WHOM IT BLAMED FOR THE ATTACK.  HOWEVER, THE
ATTACKERS REPORTEDLY CROSSED THE BORDER INTO COLOMBIA.

QUESTIONS FOR THE BOGOTA ELECTRICAL ENERGY INSTITUTE EMPLOYEE WHO WAS
AT THE SITE OF THE INCIDENT.  WE ARE OBSERVING A TERRIBLE SCENE OF
DESOLATION AND DEATH BECAUSE ALL THE PASSANGERS GOING TO CALI, VALLE
DEL CAUCA DEPARTMENT, DIED.  THERE IS NO SINGLE SURVIVOR ACCORDING TO
NATIONAL POLICE REPORTS.  THEY ARE AWAITING CRIMINAL INSTRUCTION
JUDGES.  HOWEVER, THE ELECTRICITY COMPANY WORKER MAY ANSWER QUESTIONS
POSED BY STUDIO REPORTERS.  LATER ON WE WILL HAVE MORE OFFICIAL
INFORMATION.

   [STUDIO REPORTER] CAN YOU CONFIRM THE ARRIVAL OF THE POLICE'S BOMB
SQUAD?  AUTHORITIES FEAR THE CRASH MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY AN
EXPLOSION RATHER THAN AN ACCIDENT INSIDE THE AIRPLANE.

   [REPORTER] THE F-2 JUDICIAL POLICE AND CRIMINAL STATISTICS EXPERTS
ARE HERE.  THEY FEEL THAT THE ACCIDENT MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY A
TERRORIST ACTION.  THE REMARK WAS MADE BASED ON WITNESS ACCOUNTS.
THEY NOTED THAT THIS MAY HAVE BEEN A TERRORIST ATTACK BECAUSE
AIRPLANES DO NOT HAVE THIS KIND OF ACCIDENT UNLESS THERE IS AN
EXPLOSION, SOMETHING THAT HAS VERY SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES.  ACCORDING TO
REPORTS BY THE NATIONAL POLICE F-2 EXPERTS, THE AIRPLANE BROKE INTO
SIX PIECES.  IT IS COMPLETELY DESTROYED, WHICH IS WHY THE 106
PASSENGERS ABOARD ARE STREWN ACROSS AN AREA 6-8 KM WIDE.

   ACCESS TO THE AIRPLANE'S REMAINS IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE THIS IS A
MOUNTAINOUS REGION.  THE CASQUITO [WORD INDISTINCT] IS THROUGH THE
ROAD THAT GOES FROM BOSA, CUNDINAMARCA DEPARTMENT, TO THE SCHOOL [NOT
FURTHER IDENTIFIED].  AUTHORITIES SAY THAT THIS AREA IS LOCATED VERY
CLOSE TO SLUICE NUMBER 3, MUNA 3, WHICH FEEDS WATER TO THE DAM.  THE
SITUATION IS VERY DIFFICULT AND DRAMATIC.  RIGHT NOW, EXPERTS ARE
COLLECTING SAMPLES AND TRYING FIND ALL THEY CAN TO LEARN FOR SURE IF
THIS WAS A TERRORIST ACTION OR A SERIOUS ACCIDENT CAUSED BY A FLAW IN
THE MECHANICAL SYSTEM OF THE HK-1803 AIRPLANE.

THROUGH ILLEGAL MEANS; AND FINES THAT ARE IMPOSED FOR USE OF FORCE TO
ACHIEVE A POLITICAL OUTCOME.

   THE SUPREME COURT DECLARED THE FOLLOWING DECREE UNCONSTITUTIONAL:

   SAN SALVADOR, 5 OCT 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] TODAY, RELIEF
ORGANIZATIONS EVACUATED DOZENS OF PEOPLE WHO WERE LOCKED INSIDE "LA
CENTROAMERICANA" BUILDING IN SAN SALVADOR WHERE THE COSTA RICAN
EMBASSY IS LOCATED.  HOWEVER, THE EMBASSY CONTINUES TO BE OCCUPIED BY
APPROXIMATELY 50 DEMONSTRATORS.

   AMBASSADOR JESUS FERNANDEZ AND ANOTHER TWO DIPLOMATS, AS WELL AS
THREE SALVADORAN TELEVISION JOURNALISTS, ARE STILL BEING HELD HOSTAGE.

   APPROXIMATELY 50 PEOPLE LEFT THE BUILDING IN WHICH THEY WERE LOCKED
FOR 5 HOURS FOLLOWING THE OCCUPATION OF THE EMBASSY BY MEMBERS AND
SYMPATHIZERS OF THE MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO FEDERATION OF COMMITTEES
OF MOTHERS AND RELATIVES (FECMAFAM) OF POLITICAL PRISONERS AND
MURDERED AND MISSING PEOPLE.

   THE AMBASSADOR AND OTHER EMBASSY OFFICIALS STILL REMAIN ON THE
THIRD FLOOR OF THE BUILDING, WHICH WAS SURROUNDED BY DOZENS OF RIOT
POLICEMEN EXPERT IN ANTITERRORIST STRUGGLE, ARMED WITH HIGH-CALIBER
RIFLES.

   RED CROSS, GREEN CROSS, AND RELIEF COMMAND MEMBERS PARTICIPATED IN
THE EVACUATION OF THE OFFICES IN THE BUILDING.

   COLONEL ALEJANDRO SANCHEZ, DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE SALVADORAN
NATIONAL POLICE, SAID THAT "THE PROBLEM COULD BE SOLVED WITHIN THE
NEXT 24 HOURS, BUT OFFICIAL SOURCES RULED OUT THE USE OF FORCE.

   MAURICIO SANDOVAL, DIRECTOR OF THE PRESIDENCY'S COMMUNICATIONS
SECRETARIAT, WENT TO "LA CENTROAMERICANA" BUILDING, LOCATED IN EL
SALVADOR'S BUSINESS DISTRICT, TO LEARN ABOUT THE SITUATION AND
DESCRIBED THE OCCUPATION AS A "PROPAGANDA ACT" IN VIEW OF THE FACT
THAT THE SECOND ROUND OF TALKS BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND
THE GUERRILLAS, SCHEDULED FOR 16 AND 17 OCTOBER IN SAN JOSE (COSTA
RICA), IS DRAWING CLOSER.

   THE FECMAFAM OCCUPIED THE COSTA RICAN EMBASSY TO PROTEST "AN
INCREASE IN REPRESSION AGAINST POPULAR ORGANIZATIONS UNLEASHED BY
ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S FASCIST GOVERNMENT," FECMAFAM SPOKESMEN SAID.

   MOST OF THOSE OCCUPYING THE EMBASSY ARE WOMEN WEARING WHITE SCARFS
AND YOUTHS CARRYING WET HANDKERCHIEFS TO AVOID THE EFFECTS OF TEAR
GAS.

   SANDOVAL DISCLOSED THAT A WORKING COMMISSION HAS BEEN FORMED TO
MAINTAIN CONSULTATIONS WITH THE COSTA RICAN GOVERNMENT "AND IS MAKING
PERTINENT CONTACTS" TO SEEK A QUICK SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM.

   THE OFFICIAL STRESSED: "WE WILL NOT BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS" WITH THE
EMBASSY OCCUPIERS, WHOM, ACCORDING TO THE AMBASSADOR, ARE ARMED.

   THE PRESIDENTIAL SPOKESMAN ALSO REPORTED THAT, IN THE WAKE OF THESE
INCIDENTS, FERNANDEZ HAD A SLIGHT CARDIAC PROBLEM, BUT HAS ALREADY
GOTTEN OVER IT.

   ACCORDING TO THIS OFFICIAL, FERNANDEZ' WIFE SENT HIM MEDICINE AND
FOOD.

   SANDOVAL ANNOUNCED THAT AN OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE WILL BE ISSUED
WITHIN THE NEXT FEW HOURS.

DESTROYED EARLY THIS MORNING WHEN AN INCENDIARY BOMB EXPLODED AT THE
MONTERIA AIRPORT.  MONTERIA IS THE CAPITAL OF CORDOBA DEPARTMENT AND

THE FRONT PART OF THE PLANE, AS WELL AS THE COCKPIT, WERE BURNED WHEN
A BOMB, PLANTED BY UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS, EXPLODED.  NO VICTIMS WERE
REPORTED.

DAMAGED" BY THE FLAMES; HOWEVER, THE EMBASSY DID NOT SPECIFY THE
ORIGIN OF THE FIRE.  ACCORDING TO EMBASSY SPOKESMAN PETER SAMSON, THE
PLANE IS THE PROPERTY OF THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT'S INTERNATIONAL
NARCOTICS MATTERS (INM).

   THE PLANE, WHICH WAS RETURNING TO THE UNITED STATES AFTER
FULFILLING A MISSION IN PERU, HAD BEEN PARKED AT THE MONTERIA AIRPORT

ONE OF ITS ENGINES FAILED, THE EMBASSY SPOKESMAN ADDED.

EXPLOSION WAS HEARD.  THE FIREMEN INTERVENED QUICKLY TO PREVENT THE
FIRE FROM SPREADING AND COMPLETELY DESTROYING THE PLANE.

DETACHMENT SUFFERED ONE CASUALTY DURING A CLASH IN SAN PATRICIO
NEIGHBORHOOD.  IT HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED THAT FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] FORCES HAVE SET UP BARRICADES ON THE

NORTHERN TRUNK ROAD, WHERE BARRICADES WERE ALSO SET UP.  THE REPORT
ADDS THAT THE ENEMY SHOWED UP 90 MINUTES AFTER THE BARRICADES HAD BEEN
SET UP AND HEAVY FIGHTING RESULTED.  THE ENEMY TROOPS SUFFERED FOUR

   HAVANA (CUBA), 14 NOV 89 (TELE-REBELDE NETWORK) -- [TEXT] GUERRILLA
UNITS ARE FIGHTING SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT FORCES A FEW METERS FROM
THEIR GENERAL BARRACKS AND IN THE CAPITAL NEIGHBORHOODS OF SAN MARTIN
AND GENERAL ARCE.

   A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT, FMLN, AND BROADCAST BY RADIO VENCEREMOS INDICATES THAT THE

   GUATEMALA CITY, 18 MAY 90 (EL GRAFICO) -- [TEXT] GENERAL HECTOR
GRAMAJO MORALES HAS REPORTED THAT LAST NIGHT'S TERRORIST ACTS WERE
PROBABLY INTENDED TO DAMAGE GUATEMALAN AIR FORCE INSTALLATIONS, BUT
ONE OF THE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES WENT OFF PREMATURELY.

   HE ADDED THAT ONE OF THE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES HIT A WALL OF THE AIR
FORCE INSTALLATIONS AND THE SHOCK WAVE FROM THE EXPLOSION DAMAGED SOME
BUILDINGS.

   ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY CONCLUSIONS, THE ATTACK WAS PROBABLY A
PROPAGANDA PLOY BECAUSE THE DEVICES WERE RUDIMENTARY AND SIMILAR TO
FIRECRACKERS.

   THE TERRORIST ACTIONS SEEM TO BE MOTIVATED BY THE FACT THAT THE
IRREGULAR GROUPS ARE SHRINKING CONSIDERABLY.  EVIDENCE OF THIS IS THE
FACT THAT A SUBVERSIVE WHO SURRENDERED ON THE SOUTHERN COAST WAS
CARRYING SOME IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS IN WHICH THE GUERRILLAS ADMITTED
THAT THEY HAD MADE A BIG EFFORT TO SHOW THEIR PRESENCE, BUT THAT
NOTHING SUBSTANTIAL RESULTED AND THEY SUFFERED MANY CASUALTIES
INSTEAD, GRAMAJO SAID.

   WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT THE POSSIBLE IMPACT OF THESE TERRORIST
ACTIONS ON THE TALKS BEING HELD IN OSLO, NORWAY, GRAMAJO SAID THAT
THOSE WHO ARE TAKING PART IN THE TALKS DO NOT MAINTAIN CONTACT WITH
THE GROUPS THAT CARRY OUT THE TERRORIST ACTIONS.

   AMONG THOSE GROUPS, THERE IS ONE FACTION THAT IS CALLED THE
INTERNATIONAL MILITANT GROUP.  THIS FACTION IS COMPRISED OF PERSONS
WHO LOVE ADVENTURE; THESE PEOPLE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SUBVERSIVE GROUPS
TO ENGAGE IN SOME OF THESE ACTIVITIES.
