 CLANDESTINE, 8 JAN 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [STATION COMMENTARY] [TEXT] GOODBYE [AIR FORCE(PERP) COMMANDER] GENERAL RAFAEL BUSTILLO, FALSE HOPE FOR MASS KILLERS.

GEN.  BUSTILLO RESIGNS OR IS MADE TO RESIGN AS THE AIR FORCE(PERP) CHIEF.

ONE WOULD HAVE TO ASK BUSTILLO IF THE AIR FORCE(PERP), OF WHICH HE REPRESENTED ITS MOST ENCOURAGING PILLAR, WAS SOFT WHEN IT MURDERED 70,000 SALVADORANS, MONSIGNOR ARNULFO ROMERO AND THE JESUIT PRIESTS INCLUDED, AND EVEN WHEN IT MURDERED PATRIOT OFFICERS OF THAT SAME ARMY.

CRISTIANI ANNOUNCED ON SUNDAY THAT "MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES(PERP)" PARTICIPATED IN THE CRIME, AND THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WILL BRING THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO JUSTICE IN EL SALVADOR, "REGARDLESS OF WHOM THEY MAY BE."


#########################################################


[ZAMORA] THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT CRISTIANI ACKNOWLEDGES THAT MEMBERS OF THE ARMY(PERP) WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MASSACRE IS A FIRST STEP AND DEFINITELY A GOOD THING, BUT IT IS ENTIRELY INSUFFICIENT UNLESS THE SUBSEQUENT STEPS ARE ALSO TAKEN.

THE ARMY(PERP) HIGH COMMAND CANNOT FAIL TO KNOW THIS.

IT ALSO SHOWS THAT THE GOVERNMENT ARMY(PERP), AFTER 10 YEARS OF U.S. TRAINING, IS AN ARMY(PERP) WHOSE MILITARY STANCE IS DEFENSIVE, NOT OFFENSIVE (WHICH IS THE KEY TO U.S. MILITARY STRATEGY.)

WHILE THIS ALL SHOWS THAT THERE CAN ONLY BE A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS, IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT PRECISELY FOLLOWING THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE (AND THIS IS THE PARADOX) THE ARMY(PERP) STIFFENED ITS STANCE AGAINST NEGOTIATIONS.

ALFREDO CRISTIANI HIMSELF--WHO, TOGETHER WITH ARMED FORCES(PERP) OFFICERS, SAID HOURS AFTER THE JESUITS AND THEIR MAIDS HAD BEEN MURDERED THAT THERE WERE SUSPICIONS THAT THE FMLN COULD BE INVOLVED IN THE MASSACRE--HAS JUST ACCEPTED, ESPECIALLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE U.S. CONGRESS, THAT ARMED FORCES(PERP) PERSONNEL WERE THE ONES WHO MURDERED THE TOP BRAINS, THE BEST INTELLECTUALS OF EL SALVADOR.

IF IT IS TRUE THAT THE ARMY--WHICH MURDERED MONSIGNO OSCAR ROMERO, 1,000 PEASANTS IN EL MOZOTE, 70 INDIANS IN LAS HOJAS, HUNDREDS OF SALVADORANS IN ZUNPU, AND UNIONISTS AT THE FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION] OFFICES, ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE ARMED FORCES(PERP)' WELL-KNOWN CRIMES--IS GOING TO BE PURGED AT LAST, IF THIS IS REALLY TRUE, THEN WE WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT A TRUE NEGOTIATION WILL START.

I BELIEVE THIS IS WHERE THE FMLN(PERP) SAYS IT FIGHTS HEROICALLY FOR 4 HOURS TO BURN SEVEN PATCHES OF CROPS AND HOW IT CLAIMS IT HEROICALLY FIGHTS TO DOWN POWER TOWERS, WHICH ARE UNMOVING OBJECTS.

AS I SAID, THESE ARE COWARDLY ACTIONS, CARRIED OUT IN THE DARK, AND THE FMLN(PERP) FLEES WHEN IT SEES OUR WELL-TRAINED MEN IN MILITARY UNIFORM.

THE ELN(PERP) HAS CARRIED OUT A DESTRUCTIVE WAVE OF ATTACKS AGAINST THE COLOMBIAN OIL INDUSTRY TO FORCE THE GOVERNMENT TO NATIONALIZE THIS INDUSTRY.

THE GUERRILLA GROUP'S WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN A DIALOGUE IS CONVEYED IN A TAPE SENT TO CONSERVATIVE SENATOR ALVARO LEYVA FROM FORMER SPANISH PRIEST MANUEL PEREZ, WHO IS THE ELN(PERP)'S FOUNDER AND LEADER.

TO THIS END HE HAS MET SEVERAL TIMES WITH M-19 [19 APRIL MOVEMENT] AND REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA (FARC) COMMANDERS, WHICH IS WHY THE ELN(PERP) SELECTED HIM AS THE BEARER OF ITS MESSAGE.

THE ELN(PERP) HAS CONCENTRATED ITS TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST THE COUNTRY'S MAIN OIL PIPELINE, WHICH EXTENDS 800 KM FROM THE EASTERN TO THE NORTHWESTERN REGIONS OF COLOMBIA.

THE M-19 GUERRILLA GROUP(PERP), FOUNDED IN THE EARLY 1970'S AND CONSIDERED ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S MOST ACTIVE, BECAME RENOWNED WHEN IT OCCUPIED THE DOMINICAN EMBASSY IN BOGOTA AND HELD SEVERAL AMBASSADORS HOSTAGE AND WHEN IT LATER OCCUPIED THE PALACE OF JUSTICE, WHERE SEVERAL MAGISTRATES AND SUBVERSIVES WERE KILLED.

THE NATIONAL POLICE HAVE BEEN CONFINED TO BARRACKS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY SINCE LAST NIGHT BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO SOURCES, IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE SHINING PATH AND THE TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MRTA(PERP)) WILL TRY TO STAGE VIOLENT ACTS DURING THE MEETINGS.

THE ROUNDUPS ARE ALSO BEING CARRIED OUT TO FIND LOCAL TELEVISION MAGNATE HECTOR DELGADO PARKER, WHO WAS APPARENTLY KIDNAPPED BY THE MRTA(PERP) DURING AN INCIDENT IN WHICH DELGADO'S DRIVER WAS KILLED AND HIS BODYGUARD WOUNDED.

WE THINK THIS IS PART OF WHAT THE FMLN(PERP) [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT(PERP)] HAS BEEN DOING.

[BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] I WILL NOT REFER TO MONSIGNOR ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS ALONE, BUT TO ALL OF THE ORGANIZATIONS LINKED TO THE FMLN(PERP) THAT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DISCREDIT THE GOVERNMENT.

I THINK IF ONE TRIES TO BE OBJECTIVE AND REALISTIC, HE WILL REALIZE THAT THE FMLN(PERP) HAS BEEN TRYING TO MAKE THE HOMELAND FALL INTO A STATE OF TOTAL ANARCHY.

THESE EVENTS MUST BE SEEN IN THE LIGHT OF WHAT THE FMLN(PERP) SAID IT WOULD DO.

[END RECORDING]  AS FOR THE UPCOMING DIALOGUE MEETING TO BE HELD IN SAN JOSE ON 16 AND 17 OCTOBER, CRISTIANI SAID A COMMISSION IS READY TO RESUME TALKS WITH THE FMLN(PERP), TO WHICH A CEASE-FIRE WILL BE PROPOSED, AMONG OTHER THINGS.

 LIMA, 15 OCT 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] VICTOR POLAY, THE LEADER OF THE PERUVIAN TERRORIST TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT(PERP) (MRTA(PERP)) GROUP, TODAY ADMITTED THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE MRTA(PERP) WILL PROPOSE HIS RELEASE IN EXCHANGE FOR THE RELEASE OF TELEVISION IMPRESARIO HECTOR DELGADO PARKER.

LAST THURDAY [12 OCTOBER], THE WEEKLY "CAMBIO," WHICH IS DESCRIBED BY POLICE SOURCES AS THE MRTA(PERP)'S UNOFFICIAL MOUTHPIECE, REPORTED THAT THE MRTA(PERP) -- WHICH UPHOLDS THE BELIEFS OF GUERRILLA ERNESTO "CHE" GUEVARA -- KIDNAPPED IMPRESARIO DELGADO PARKER ON 4 OCTOBER 1989 IN LIMA, SAYING THAT HE WILL BE TRIED "BY A REVOLUTIONARY COURT."

POLAY TOLD "LA REPUBLICA" THAT THE KIDNAPPING OF THE IMPORTANT PERUVIAN TELEVISION IMPRESARIO IS OF A"POLITICAL" NATURE AND IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER KIDNAPPINGS OF OTHER PROMINENT TYCOONS CARRIED OUT BY THE MRTA(PERP) PEOPLE TO OBTAIN RANSOM MONEY, AND THAT, THEREFORE, THE PETITION THAT WILL BE MADE "MUST BE POLITICAL."

THE PUBLICATION OF POLAY'S INTERVIEW TODAY COINCIDES WITH REPORTS BY LOCAL NEWSPAPERS ON THE CAPTURE OF 12 REGIONAL MRTA(PERP) LEADERS.

THE NATIONAL POLICE HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT THE OPERATIONS, LEADING TO THE CAPTURE OF THE MRTA(PERP) LEADERS, HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS, AND THAT ACTIVISTS, WHO WERE OPERTING IN THE DEPARTMENTS OF CAJAMARCA, LA LIBERTAD, AND ANCASH IN NORTHERN PERU AND WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR AT LEAST 20 BOMB ATTACKS IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS, HAVE BEEN DETAINED.

THE NATIONAL POLICE ADDED THAT FIREARMS, EXPLOSIVES, AND PROPAGANDA MATERIAL WERE SEIZED FROM THE MRTA(PERP) LEADERS.

THIS CRIME, VICIOUSLY AND COLDLY CARRIED OUT BY THE FMLN(PERP), CLEARLY SHOWS THE WORLD THE FMLN(PERP) IS AN ORGANIZATION LED AND MADE UP BY INDIVIDUALS FOR WHOM HUMAN LIFE MEANS NOTHING.

THIS DESPICABLE CRIME PERPETRATED AGAINST MS CASONOVA PORRAS CONFIRMS THE FMLN(PERP) IS IMPLEMENTING A DEATH-LIKE TERRORIST PLAN THAT INCLUDES THE MURDER OF PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND THEIR RELATIVES, AS THE PRESIDENT PUBLICLY CHARGED ON 14 OCTOBER.

CONDEMNING THIS NEW CRIME BY FMLN(PERP) URBAN CELLS, THE GOVERNMENT ASKS: HOW CAN FMLN(PERP) LEADERS IN COSTA RICA TALK OF PEACE AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS WHEN DEFENSELESS PERSONS ARE BEING RUTHLESSLY AND IRRATIONALLY MURDERED ON ORDERS FROM THE FMLN(PERP)?

MOREOVER, IT ASKS THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY OF NATIONS AND HUMAN RIGHTS RAPPORTEUR PROFESSOR PASTOR RIDREJO TO TAKE DUE NOTICE OF THIS DESPICABLE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION CARRIED OUT BY THE FMLN(PERP) AT A TIME WHEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT DELEGATION IS ENGAGED IN A DIALOGUE IN GOOD FAITH AND WITH THE BEST POLITICAL INTENTIONS TO REACH PEACE, SOMETHING THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE YEARN FOR.

THE GOVERNMENT HOLDS THE FMLN(PERP) RESPONSIBLE FOR JEOPARDIZING THE DIALOGUE PROCESS TO REACH PEACE, AND HOPES THAT THE FMLN(PERP) ADOPTS A RESPONSIBLE STAND AND THAT ITS PEACEFUL WORDS ARE MATCHED BY DEEDS.

 SAN JOSE, 17 OCT 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] NO CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENT WAS REACHED AT THE END OF THE SECOND DAY OF THE CURRENT ROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN DELEGATES OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT(PERP) (FMLN(PERP)) AND THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.

DURING THE DIALOGUE, THE DELEGATES BECAME INVOLVED IN A DISCUSSION ON IMPLEMENTATION OF A POSSIBLE CEASE-FIRE AND THE FMLN(PERP) INSISTED THAT THERE MUST FIRST BE APPROVAL OF A PLAN TO AMEND THE SALVADORAN CONSTITUTION, THAT THE ARMY BE PURGED, THAT THE REPRESSION END, THAT MODIFICATIONS TO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM BE STARTED, AND THAT MEASURES BE ADOPTED TO GUARANTEE THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIZATION.

FOR THEIR PART, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT DELEGATES INSISTED THAT THE FMLN(PERP) MUST DECLARE AN IMMEDIATE HALT TO HOSTILITIES EFFECTIVE 18 OCTOBER.

FMLN(PERP) COMMANDER JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS SAID: "WE CANNOT ACCEPT THE GOVERNMENT'S CONDITIONS FOR THE CEASE-FIRE BECAUSE THAT WOULD MEAN A SURRENDER ON OUR PART."

FMLN(PERP) SPOKESMAN MIGUEL SAENZ SAID: "THERE ARE NO AGREEMENTS WITH THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THERE ARE NO CONCRETE REPLIES TO OUR REQUESTS."

JUSTICE MINISTER OSCAR ALFREDO SANTAMARIA SAID: "FIRST WE NEED THE FMLN(PERP) TO CEASE HOSTILITIES, THEN THE GOVERNMENT WILL GUARANTEE THAT THE GUERRILLAS CAN RETURN TO THE MAINSTREAM OF SOCIETY.

DURING THE SECOND DAY OF TALKS, THERE WAS FRICTION BETWEEN THE FMLN(PERP) AND THE GOVERNMENT WHEN INFORMATION SECRETARY MAURICIO SANDOVAL OPENLY ACCUSED THE FMLN(PERP) OF MURDERING ANA ISABEL CASANOVA [NAME AS RECEIVED], DAUGHTER OF COLONEL OSCAR EDGARDO CASANOVA, DIRECTOR OF THE ARMED FORCES STUDIES CENTER.

FMLN(PERP) COMMANDER "LUISA" MERCEDES DEL CARMEN RETANA IMMEDIATELY DENIED SANDOVAL'S CHARGE AND SAID: "THE FMLN(PERP) HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT MURDER PERPETRATED TODAY IN SAN SALVADOR."

THE MURDER ALSO PROMPTED ACCUSATIONS IN THE MEETING BY THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES WHO SAID: "THE FMLN(PERP) IS IN THE HABIT OF PERPETRATING THIS SORT OF ACTIONS WHEN IMPORTANT MEETINGS ARE BEING HELD."

THE FMLN(PERP) DELEGATES SAID: "THE CHARGE AGAINST THE FMLN(PERP) IS GROUNDLESS."

THIS AFTERNOON, MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ SEEMED VERY SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE RESULTS OF THE SAN JOSE TALKS, "BECAUSE FOR THE DIALOGUE TO SUCCEED IT IS NECESSARY AND URGENT THAT THE TWO SIDES, THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN(PERP), YIELD A LITTLE."

IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE DIALOGUE MAY CONTINUE TOMORROW WHEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN(PERP) ANNOUNCED THEY WILL ISSUE SEPARATE PRESS RELEASES.

 NO CITY (EL SALVADOR), 20 OCT 89 -- [SPEECH] [CRISTIANI] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP)(PERP) HAS DONE NOTHING BUT INSIST ON AN IMMEDIATE ANSWER TO ALL OF THIS.

HOWEVER, THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP)(PERP) IMMEDIATELY REJECTED THE GOVERNMENT'S PROPOSAL, SAYING THAT IT WOULD NOT ACCEPT IT.

THAT THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP)(PERP) NO LONGER WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THE END OF THE HOSTILITIES, BUT WANTS TO INTRODUCE NEW TOPICS AT THE SAN JOSE MEETING.

HOWEVER, DESPITE THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP)(PERP)'S POSITION, AND ALTHOUGH THERE HAS NOT BEEN AN IN-DEPTH STUDY OF ALL THE DOCUMENTS, ONE CAN SEE AT FIRST GLANCE THAT THE PROPOSALS THEY HAVE PUT FORWARD ARE TOTALLY ABSURD.

I WILL CITE AN EXAMPLE: YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP)(PERP) HAS ADMITTED TO BEING UNABLE TO MAINTAIN A POSITION, THAT IF IT ATTEMPTS TO OCCUPY A TOWN, IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS THE ARMED FORCES DRIVE IT OUT.

NEVERTHELESS, THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP)(PERP) PROPOSAL ATTEMPTS TO ESTABLISH TERRITORIAL LIMITS WITH THE GOVERNMENT.

WHILE IT IS TRUE THAT THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP)(PERP) EXISTS AND IS A REALITY, I BELIEVE THAT REALITY HAS A DIMENSION, A SIZE.

THE RESULTS OF THE PAST ELECTIONS, THE RESULTS OF SOMETHING OVER 3 PERCENT [WON BY THE DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE], INDICATE THAT THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP)(PERP) IS A REALITY BUT A VERY SMALL ONE, AND THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO FORCE A GOVERNMENT AND A PEOPLE TO VIOLATE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM.

MEANWHILE, THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP)(PERP) HAS COME UP WITH THE TOTALLY ABSURD NOTION THAT THE GOVERNMENT MUST DISMISS THE ENTIRE [MILITARY] CLASS OF '66, THE DEFENSE MINISTER, AND THE COMMANDER OF THE AIR FORCE.

THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP)(PERP) PROPOSAL ALSO CALLS FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO INSTRUCT THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY TO CHANGE ALL OF THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES.

WHAT IS WORSE, HOWEVER, IS THAT ALONG WITH THE ATTITUDE THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP)(PERP) HAS DISPLAYED IN COSTA RICA, ALONG WITH ITS REJECTION OF EVERYTHING THE GOVERNMENT SAYS, ITS ATTEMPTS TO MODIFY THE AGENDA WE HAD AGREED UPON IN MEXICO, ITS EFFORTS TO INTRODUCE A SERIES OF DOCUMENTS, AND ITS DEMAND FOR IMMEDIATE ANSWERS, IT HAS INITIATED A STRATEGY OF MURDERS HERE IN EL SALVADOR.

THAT THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP)(PERP) INTENDS TO TALK OVER THERE [COSTA RICA] AND TO MAKE AN ENTIRE CASE OUT OF ITS DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS, WHILE MURDERING PEOPLE AND VIOLATING THE HUMAN RIGHTS THEY CLAIM TO BE DEFENDING, ON A DAILY BASIS.

ALL OF THESE FMLN(PERP)(PERP)(PERP) ATTITUDES FORCE US TO DIALOGUE, AND AS I SAID AT THE BEGINNING, I MUST BE COMPLETELY CLEAR AND OPEN.

I BELIEVE THAT SO FAR THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP)(PERP) HAS NOT DISPLAYED THE POLITICAL RESOLVE TO ACHIEVE PEACE.

FIRST OF ALL, THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP)(PERP) DOES NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT ENDING THE CONFLICT, IT DOES NOT WANT TO GIVE THE ENTIRE COUNTRY -- YOU AND I, MY DEAR VIEWERS -- THE OPPORTUNITY TO STOP LIVING IN THIS WHIRLPOOL OF VIOLENCE, TO LIVE IN PEACE, AND TO ALLOW THE PROCESS TO PROGRESS IN THE SEARCH FOR SOLUTIONS THAT WILL GRADUALLY GIVE US FIRM AND LASTING PEACE, WITHIN AN ATMOSPHERE OF TRANQUILITY.

THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP)(PERP)'S ATTITUDE IS ONE OF PROVOCATION.

ALL IN ALL, THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP)(PERP) IS TRYING TO FORCE THE GOVERNMENT TO DESIST.

 SAN SALVADOR, 13 NOV 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN ARMY(PERP)'S COUNTERATTACK AGAINST REBEL POSITIONS IN MEJICANOS, ON THE NORTHERN SIDE OF THE CAPITAL CITY, WAS SUSPENDED AT 1745 (2345 GMT), 1 HOUR AFTER IT BEGAN AND SO FAR THERE ARE NO REPORTS ON THE RESULTS OF IT.

TWO COLUMNS OF SOME 100 SALVADORAN ARMY(PERP) TROOPS, ARMED WITH RIFLES AND ARTILLERY WEAPONS, STARTED TO ATTACK ABOUT 150 GUERRILLAS WHO CONTROL AMPLE POSITIONS IN MEJICANOS WHERE SOME 125,000 PEOPLE LIVE.

MEANWHILE, IT WAS REPORTED THAT IN THE CONACASTE NEIGHBORHOOD OF SOYAPANGO, ALSO IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR, FIVE PRIVATE HOMES WERE STRAFFED BY ARMY(PERP) HELICOPTERS.

IN THE TOWNSHIP OF EL TULE AGUILARES, CLASHES WERE REPORTED BETWEEN 4TH BRIGADE TROOPS AND TERRORISTS FROM THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN(PERP)(PERP)].

IN SOYAPANGO, THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP) SUBVERSIVES COLDBLOODEDLY MURDERED TWO WATCHMEN AT THE INSA FACTORY.

FEELING HOUNDED AND HEMMED IN BY THE ARMED FORCES TROOPS, THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP) TERRORISTS CONTINUE TO RESORT TO [3-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION] TO KIDNAP YOUTHS, ON THIS OCCASION FROM THE AMATEPEC NEIGHBORHOOD ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF SAN SALVADOR.

THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP) TERRORISTS WHO ARE MAKING A DESPERATE RETREAT FROM THE SUBURBS OF SAN SALVADOR HAVE ABANDONED 27 OF THEIR DEAD COMRADES IN CIUDAD CREDISA.

THESE PEOPLE SHED THEIR BLOOD IN VAIN FOR IDEALS THAT DO NOT TRULY SEEK THE WELFARE OF SALVADORANS, BUT INSTEAD THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OPPROBIOUS AND TOTALITARIAN DICTATORSHIP THAT THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP) TERRORISTS WOULD LIKE TO IMPOSE.

THERE IS NO PLACE FOR THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP) HERE IN EL SALVADOR.

LEADERS OF THE RULING NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA) HAVE CONFIRMED THAT GUERRILLAS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT(PERP)(PERP) (FMLN(PERP)(PERP)) HAD PLANNED TO KIDNAP PRESIDENT CRISTIANI "BUT WE DO NOT KNOW FOR WHAT PURPOSE."

THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP) ON 11 NOVEMBER BEGAN A LARGE-SCALE MILITARY OFFENSIVE WHICH INCLUDED ATTACKS AT MORE THAN 50 POINTS NATIONWIDE, ESPECIALLY ARMY POSITIONS.

COMMANDER JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS, ONE OF THE FIVE TOP FMLN(PERP)(PERP) LEADERS, ANNOUNCED THAT 7 OF THE COUNTRY'S 14 DEPARTMENTS WERE DECLARED "FREED ZONES."

THE REBELS MAINTAIN THAT THE OFFENSIVE IS DESIGNED TO BRING THE GOVERNMENT AND FMLN(PERP)(PERP) "TO AN EQUAL FOOTING" IN SEEKING A NEGOTIATED POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE WAR CONFLICT.


#########################################################


IT IS REGRETTABLE AND INCONCEIVABLE THAT THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT(PERP)(PERP) [FMLN(PERP)(PERP)] SHOULD PERSIST WITH THE AGGRESSION IT HAS UNLEASHED AGAINST OUR CAPITAL CITY AND SURROUNDING MUNICIPALITIES.

OUR POPULATION HAS SUFFERED THE MOST FROM THIS FMLN(PERP)(PERP) AGGRESSION.

THIS AGGRESSION, SALVADORAN FRIENDS, MUST BE SEEN AS AN ACT OF DESPERATION BY THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP), AS THIS IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN EXPLAIN THEIR IRRATIONAL ACTIONS.

I HAVE USED THE WORD DESPERATION BECAUSE THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP) KNOWS THAT IT IS OUT OF STYLE AND THAT ITS ATTITUDES ARE NO LONGER ACCEPTED IN THE WORLD.

WE CAN SEE IN EUROPE THAT COUNTRIES HAVE PASSED FROM TOTALITARIAN REGIMES SUCH AS THE ONE THAT THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP) WANTS TO IMPLEMENT HERE, AND WALLS ARE OPEN FOR LIBERTY AND DEMOCRACY.

THAT IS WHY THEY HAVE NOT SUPPORTED AND WILL NEVER SUPPORT THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP) TERRORISTS WHO WANT TO SUBJECT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO TOTALITARIAN REGIMES, TO DICTATORSHIPS OF OPPRESSION, REPRESSION, AND VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS.

THERE ARE ALREADY MORE THAN 100 DEAD OR WOUNDED BECAUSE OF THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP)'S IRRATIONAL ACTIONS.

IN ADDITION, IT IS APPROPRIATE TO SEE HOW FAR THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP) TERRORISTS' IRRATIONAL MINDS CAN GO, BECAUSE THEY HAVE CARRIED OUT ACTS OF SAVAGERY THAT WE CANNOT UNDERSTAND.

SALVADORAN PEOPLE: THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP) IS ALREADY A DESPERATE BEAST.

HOWEVER, WE MUST REALIZE AND UNDERSTAND, AND ABOVE ALL, BE SURE THAT THE MAJORITY OF OUR PEOPLE REPUDIATE THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP) TERRORISTS.

THE ARMED FORCES COULD DRIVE THOSE TERRORISTS OUT OF WHERE THEY ARE; HOWEVER, THERE ARE CIVILIANS THERE, AND WE WOULD NEVER WANT TO EXPOSE THOSE CIVILIANS TO THE DANGER THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP) IS TRYING TO LEAD THEM INTO.

WE KNOW THAT ALL OF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE AN END TO THIS TERROR THAT THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP) WANTS TO CREATE.

HOWEVER, WE MUST ALSO UNDERSTAND, PARTICULARLY THOSE OF US WHO ARE NOT AS ANGUISHED AT THIS MOMENT AS THOSE FAMILIES THAT HAVE BECOME FMLN(PERP)(PERP) HOSTAGES.

THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP) FAILED TO ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVE.

WE ALSO MAKE A SPECIAL CALL TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO NOT BE TAKEN IN BY UNFOUNDED NEWS SPREAD BY THE FMLN(PERP) MARXIST-LENINIST GUERILLAS, WITH WHICH THEY TRY TO HIDE THEIR FAILED ARMED ADVENTURE AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES HAVE PROFESSIONALLY REPELLED MOST OF THE INVADERS' REDOUBTS, THROUGH WHICH THE FMLN(PERP) IS ATTEMPTING TO SEIZE POWER THROUGH A GENERALIZED MASSACRE AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

THE ASSASSINS WHO ACTED UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE CURFEW ARE FROM THE SALVADORAN ARMY(PERP), THEY ARE NOT UNIDENTIFIED TERRORISTS, LIKE THE AP CABLE SAYS.

THEY ARE ASSASSINS OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY(PERP), THE SAME ARMY WHICH HAS ALL THE SUPPORT OF THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT.

HOWEVER, IN PRACTICE, IT SUPPORTS THE ASSASSINS OF PRIESTS AND SUPPLIES BOMBS AND ROCKETS SO THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMY(PERP) -- WHICH HAS PLANES AND HELICOPTERS PROVIDED BY THE UNITED STATES -- CAN BOMB THE SALVADORAN CIVILIAN POPULATION.

THE FMLN(PERP) TERRORISTS DO NOT SATISFY THEIR INSTINCTS BY KILLING CIVILIANS AND THE UCA [CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY] JESUITS, NOW THEY ARE AIMING THEIR CRIMINAL MACHINEGUNS AT JOURNALISTS.

THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE PEOPLE, TOGETHER WITH THE GLORIOUS ARMED FORCES, REPEAT THEIR CALL TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO REPUDIATE THE FMLN(PERP) ASSASSINS.

THE CIVILIANS WHO GAVE BLUNDY FIRST AID HAVE TOLD US THAT THE NEWSMAN WAS HIT BY AN FMLN(PERP) SNIPER WHEN HE WAS GREETING AN OFFICER OF OUR GLORIOUS ARMED FORCES IN MEJICANOS.

THIS ACTION ONCE MORE CONFIRMS THE TREACHEROUS AND FLAGRANT HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS OF THE FMLN(PERP) ASSASSINS, WHO ARE BEING REPUDIATED BY THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

IT WAS A CRIME [WORD INDISTINCT] BY THE GENERAL STAFF(PERP) AND MR. CRISTIANI KNEW ABOUT IT.


#########################################################


CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT(PERP) AND THE SALVADORAN ARMY HAVE LOST CONTROL OVER THEIR ACTIONS BECAUSE OF THEIR DESPERATION OVER THE FMLN'S VICTORIOUS ADVANCE.

ACTING OUT OF REVENGE, CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT(PERP) AND THE SALVADORAN ARMY BEGAN A SERIES OF CRIMINAL ACTIONS AIMED AT ALL THOSE WHO HAVE IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES WITH THE FAIR CAUSES OF THE SALVADORAN MAJORITY.


#########################################################


THE 7 DAYS OF OUR OFFENSIVE HAVE EXPOSED THE MILITARY FASCIST DICTATORSHIP(PERP) TO THE EYES OF THE WORLD.

THESE CRIMES COMMITTED BY CRISTIANI AND COLONEL PONCE [CHAIRMAN OF THE ARMED FORCES(PERP) JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF] DEFINITELY ISOLATE THEM FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD, WHICH CONDEMNS THEM AND RECALLS THE LAST DAYS OF SOMOZA.


#########################################################


SIX JESUITS, FIVE OF THEM OF SPANISH BACKGROUND, WERE ASSASSINATED ON 16 NOVEMBER BY MEN WEARING MILITARY(PERP) UNIFORMS.

UNGO WILL ALSO ASK FOR THE "IMMEDIATE" RESUMPTION OF THE PEACE TALKS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT(PERP) AND THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN).

THE GOVERNMENT(PERP) AND THE GUERRILLAS HAD BEEN SCHEDULED TO HOLD A THIRD ROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS IN CARACAS ON 20 NOVEMBER, BUT AFTER THE ASSASSINATION OF 10 LABOR LEADERS THE FMLN ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK IT WOULD NOT ATTEND.


#########################################################


THE OFFICIAL DELEGATION CAME TO EL SALVADOR AFTER SIX JESUITS, FIVE OF THEM SPANISH, WERE MURDERED BY INDIVIDUALS WEARING MILITARY(PERP) UNIFORMS.

WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THEY MAY BE MILITARY(PERP) MEMBERS, HE ANSWERED THAT "THE ARMED FORCES HAVE NOT RULED OUT THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN MEMBERS OF THE ARMY(PERP), AND THEY ARE DETERMINED TO INVESTIGATE THIS THOROUGHLY."

HOWEVER, CRISTIANI REJECTED THE "PREMATURE INTERPRETATIONS" THAT CLAIM THE MILITARY(PERP) CARRIED OUT THE MULTIPLE CRIME.

TODAY MARKS THE 8TH DAY OF THE BLOODY FIGHTING BETWEEN THE ARMY(PERP) AND THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS.


#########################################################


BEFORE THROWING SEVERAL PACKAGES OF DYNAMITE, THE ASSAILANTS PAINTED THE WALLS OF THE DIPLOMATIC RESIDENCE WITH THE WORDS FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT(PERP), AS WELL AS OTHER WORDS WHICH MADE REFERENCE TO THE POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN EL SALVADOR.

SIMILARLY, THE ARMED FORCES CONGRATULATE OUR GLORIOUS CHIEFS, OFFICERS, AND TROOPS, WHO TENACIOUSLY, BRAVELY, AND HEROICALLY DEFEND OUR PEOPLE AND HOMELAND FROM THE GENOCIDE IMPOSED BY THE FMLN(PERP) HORDES.


#########################################################


NEWSPAPER FOR CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT AND THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES(PERP)(PERP)?

POLITICAL OPINION IN THE UNITED STATES HAS UNDOUBTEDLY BEEN SHAKEN BY THIS MASSACRE PLANNED BY ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT(PERP)(PERP).

THESE CASES HAVE BEEN SURROUNDED BY ABSOLUTE SECRECY; NO CULPRITS ARE FOUND; AND WITNESSES HAVE TESTIFIED MANY TIMES THAT THE ACTIONS WERE CARRIED OUT BY ARMED FORCES(PERP)(PERP) MEMBERS, EITHER DRESSED AS CIVILIANS OR IN UNIFORM.

HOWEVER, THE POLICY OF THE ARMED FORCES(PERP)(PERP) AND THE GOVERNMENT PROTECTS THE CULPRITS.


#########################################################


[SAMAYOA] AT THE LEVEL OF THE U.S. PEOPLE, THERE IS A TOTAL REPUDIATION OF THE FASCIST CRIMINAL GOVERNMENT AND OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES BECAUSE OF THE BOMBINGS -- WHICH HAVE BECOME A TRUE GENOCIDE -- IN VARIOUS DENSELY POPULATED CITIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS IN EL SALVADOR, AS WELL AS BECAUSE OF THE ASSASSINATIONS PERPETRATED BY THE SALVADORAN ARMY(PERP) AGAINST THE JESUIT PRIESTS AT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY [UCA].

LOPEZ HAD TO LEAVE THE SANTA MARIA DE LOS POBRES CHURCH IN THE LA CHACRA SLUM AREA IN EASTERN SAN SALVADOR AFTER IT WAS BOMBED BY THE AIR FORCE(PERP), ACCORDING TO ONE OF LOPEZ' ASSISTANTS, WHO IS ALSO A SPANIARD.


#########################################################


THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S LETTER TO THE POPE WAS SENT 2 DAYS AFTER SIX JESUITS (FIVE SPANIARDS AND ONE SALVADORAN) AND TWO WOMEN WERE KILLED IN SAN SALVADOR BY A GROUP OF 30 TO 40 MEN WEARING MILITARY(PERP) UNIFORMS, ACCORDING TO WITNESSES.


#########################################################


MEANWHILE, SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI REPORTEDLY SAID YESTERDAY THAT THE ARMED FORCES(PERP)(PERP) HIGH COMMAND HAS NOT RULED OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE KILLERS OF THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS COULD HAVE BEEN SOLDIERS.

CRISTIANI, WHO INSISTED ON THE NEED TO AVOID UNFOUNDED CONCLUSIONS, ADDED THAT THE MILITARY(PERP)(PERP) DOES NOT THINK IT WILL BE AFFECTED BY SOMETHING DONE BY INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS OF THE INSTITUTION.

WHY DID THE ARMY(PERP)(PERP) NOT SEND IN TROOPS TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED ONLY A FEW BLOCKS FROM COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE'S OFFICE?

OUR QUESTION FOR WILLIAM WALKER: IF THIS WAS NOT DONE BY THE ARMED FORCES(PERP)(PERP), THEN WHY WERE THEY THERE SEARCHING THE PREMISES FOR A WHOLE HOUR AND EVEN STEALING $5,000?

HOWEVER, AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER SAYS THAT HE DOES NOT KNOW IF THE ARMY(PERP)(PERP) COMMITTED THE CRIME.


#########################################################


AND THERE IS ALSO THE GENERAL STAFF AND DEFENSE MINISTRY POSITION BLAMING THE FMLN(PERP).

IT IS IMPORTANT TO LOOK INTO THIS CLOSELY BECAUSE GEN LARIOS, IN AN EMPTY SPEECH -- WE HEARD HIM DELIVER A RHETORICAL AND EMPTY SPEECH -- ACCUSED THE FMLN(PERP) OF KILLING THE PRIESTS AND SAID THAT THE ARMY CONTROLS THE COUNTRY.

THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE SAID THAT IT IS PLEASED WITH THE WAY CRISTIANI ACTED IN THE FACE OF THE FMLN(PERP) OFFENSIVE.

#########################################################


IN OTHER WORDS, 40 MEN IN THE UNIFORM OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY(PERP) WERE A FEW BLOCKS FROM THE GENERAL STAFF PARTICIPATING IN SHOOTING THAT LASTED SEVERAL MINUTES, AND REMAINED IN THERE FOR 1 HOUR, IN AN AREA UNDER THE ARMY'S CONTROL, IN AN AREA UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE GENERAL STAFF.

HOW COULD 40 MEN IN SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES(PERP)(PERP) UNIFORMS, AND WITH POLICE AND ARMY PATROLS ONLY A FEW METERS AWAY FROM THE JESUITS' RESIDENCE, REMAIN IN THAT PLACE FOR 1 HOUR IF THEY WERE NOT MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES(PERP)?

AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER, IF YOU STILL HAVE ANY SHAME, TELL THE WORLD AND ANSWER THIS QUESTION: IF THE ARMED FORCES(PERP) GENERAL STAFF DID NOT KILL THE JESUIT PRIESTS, HOW COULD THE MURDERERS -- AS THIS INTERNATIONAL DISPATCH SAYS -- REMAIN IN THE RESIDENCE FOR 1 HOUR AFTER THE HEAVY SHOOTING, AFTER KILLING THE PRIESTS WITH MACHINEGUNS IN TRIPODS, AS THE CABLE SAYS?

MAYBE WILLIAM WALKER DOES NOT EVEN READ INTERNATIONAL DISPATCHES, BECAUSE HE CYNICALLY SAID AFTER THE PRIESTS' FUNERAL THAT HE HAD NO EVIDENCE OR INDICATION THAT THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED BY THE ARMED FORCES(PERP).

THE OLIGARCHIC RULING CLASS, WHICH IS SAID TO CONSIST OF 15 TO 240 FAMILIES WITH HIGH INCOME, LAUNCHED A "CLEAN-UP OPERATION" AGAINST GUERRILLAS IN COLLUSION WITH THE MILITARY, AND OPENLY MASSACRED THE LEADERS OF WORKERS AND PEASANTS BY ORGANIZING AN EXTREME RIGHT-WING ASSASSINATION GROUP(PERP)(PERP) CALLED THE "DEATH SQUAD(PERP)."

FILMS SUCH AS "ROMERO" AND "SALVADOR" THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN IN OUR COUNTRY IN RECENT MONTHS ARE CLEAR EVIDENCE OF THE BRUTALITY COMMITTED BY SUCH AN ASSASSINATION GROUP(PERP).

WE REPORT THAT CITIZEN JUSTINIANO SAGASTUME RODRIGUEZ, 42, WAS KILLED BY TWO BULLETS FIRED FROM A .22 CALIBER GUN BY A MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL PARTY(PERP), WHOSE NAME IS NOT KNOWN.


#########################################################


THE STRIKE, WHICH WAS DECREED BY THE INTERSECTORIAL CONFEDERATION OF PUBLIC EMPLOYEES(PERP) (CITE(PERP)), IS BEING OBSERVED BY 300,000 PUBLIC SERVANTS, WHO MAKE UP 50 PERCENT OF CITE(PERP) MEMBERS.

THE STRIKERS DEMAND SALARY IMPROVEMENTS, THE REINSTATEMENT OF 250 DISMISSED WORKERS, AND THE OFFICIAL RECOGNITION OF THE CITE(PERP).

ALVA CASTRO SAID THAT THE PRIME MINISTER TOLD HIM THAT THERE WILL BE NO PROBLEM IN RECOGNIZING THE CITE(PERP), PROVIDED THAT THIS ORGANIZATION MEETS THE APPROPRIATE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS.

THERE WERE INCIDENTS IN LIMA ON 23 NOVEMBER, WHEN GROUPS OF CITE(PERP) MEMBERS DEMONSTRATED IN DOWNTOWN LIMA AND WERE REPRESSED BY THE POLICE.

ABOUT 15 DAYS AGO, I HEARD THE NEWS THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT(PERP), THE SALVADORAN ARMY(PERP), WAS BOMBING NEIGHBORHOODS AND CITIES IN EL SALVADOR, THAT IT WAS MURDERING THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

I LATER HEARD THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMY(PERP) HAD MURDERED SIX JESUIT PRIESTS, AMONG THEM A PRIEST WHO HAD BEEN DEAN OF THE CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY HERE IN NICARAGUA.

HOW COULD I WELCOME IN NICARAGUA THE REPRESENTATIVE OF A GOVERNMENT(PERP) THAT KILLS PRIESTS AND BISHOPS, THAT KILLED MONSIGNOR ROMERO; A GOVERNMENT(PERP) THAT KILLS CLERGYMEN, THAT HAS KILLED NUNS AND MEMBERS OF OTHER CHURCHES, CATHOLICS AND EVANGELISTS; A GOVERNMENT(PERP) THAT KILLS WORKERS, PEASANTS, LABORERS, AND LEADERS OF POLITICAL PARTIES, THAT HAS KILLED MORE THAN 600 CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADERS.

THEY WERE KILLED BY ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLIC ALLIANCE], THE RULING PARTY IN EL SALVADOR, AND THE SALVADORAN ARMY(PERP), WHICH IS THE SAME THING.

IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TERRIBLE FOR THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE TO HAVE TO WELCOME AND HAVE AS A GUEST THE REPRESENTATIVE OF A GOVERNMENT(PERP) THAT KILLS PRIESTS, NUNS, WORKERS, LABORERS, PEASANTS, INTELLECTUALS, PROFESSIONALS, AND WORKERS.

IT MADE ME HAPPY BECAUSE WE HAVE AVOIDED THE PROBLEM OF HAVING TO WELCOME, IN NICARAGUA, THE PRESIDENT OF THAT GOVERNMENT(PERP) OF INTERNATIONAL KILLERS AND COMMON CRIMINALS.

AS A NICARAGUAN I FEEL PROUD THAT THAT MURDEROUS GOVERNMENT(PERP) HAS BROKEN RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA.

THE LEAST THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT(PERP) CAN DO IN RESPONSE TO THE ATTITUDE ASSUMED BY THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT(PERP) IS TO ASK AND DEMAND OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND THE WORLD THAT IT BREAK RELATIONS WITH THAT MURDEROUS AND CRIMINAL GOVERNMENT(PERP) UNTIL THOSE WHO KILLED THE PRIESTS HAVE BEEN PUNISHED, UNTIL THOSE WHO ARE KILLING THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PUNISHED.


#########################################################


AS WE HAVE ALREADY REPORTED, U.S.  OFFICIALS, IMPORTANT PERSONS, AND POLITICIANS IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE ISSUED STATEMENTS AFFIRMING THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES(PERP)(PERP) ARE DIRECTLY LINKED TO THE CASE OF THE MURDERED JESUITS.

EVEN ELLIOTT ABRAMS, FORMER ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INTER-AMERICAN AFFAIRS, HAS STATED ON THE FACE THE NATION TELEVISION PROGRAM ON 27 NOVEMBER, THAT THE MURDER OF THE SIX JESUITS, A WOMAN, AND HER DAUGHTER WAS AN ACTION BY THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES(PERP)(PERP) AND NOT THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT].

ABRAMS, A FORMER REAGAN ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL, STATED: BASED ON 10 YEARS EXPERIENCE ON THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT, I PRESUME THAT THE DEATH OF THE PRIESTS WAS NOT THE WORK OF LEFTIST GUERRILLAS, BUT AN ACTION BY FORCES OF THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION(PERP).

AT THIS TIME IN THE UNITED STATES, THE SALVADORAN TOP MILITARY COMMAND(PERP), COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, AND PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI ARE BEING POINTED OUT AS THE PERSONS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ABOMINABLE CRIME.

WE DENOUNCE THE ARREST OF U.S. CITIZEN JENNIFER CAZOLO AS PART OF A SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES(PERP)(PERP) PLAN TO ATTEMPT TO DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION FROM THE JESUITS' CASE.

ALSO, THE ARMED FORCES(PERP) IS TRYING TO LINK HUMANITARIAN AID FOR EL SALVADOR, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND U.S.-BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO THE FMLN.

WE DENOUNCE THIS ACCUSATION AS A CLUMSY SET UP BY THE ARMED FORCES(PERP) COMMAND, WHICH IS TRYING -- WE REPEAT -- TRYING TO REPRESS THESE HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS AND FOREIGNERS.

THIS IS A SET UP BY THE ARMED FORCES(PERP) TO REPRESS FOREIGN CITIZENS AND -- WE REPEAT -- IT IS A SMOKE SCREEN TO DIVERT U.S.

THE ARMED FORCES(PERP) COMMAND AND THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION ARE TRYING TO DO ALL THEY CAN TO THROW A SMOKESCREEN HERE AND THERE TO TRY TO DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND, ESPECIALLY, THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES.

IN CONCLUSION, WE REAFIRM: WE DENY THE ARMED FORCES(PERP)' ACCUSATIONS AGAINST U.S. CITIZEN JENNIFER CAZOLO.

DEATH SQUADS(PERP), WORKING CLOSELY WITH REACTIONARY MILITARY MEN AND THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION, ARE MOST CERTAINLY TO BLAME FOR THE RECENT DISGRACEFUL MURDER OF SIX PRIESTS IN EL SALVADOR, ACCORDING TO THE U.S.

SOME OF THIS MONEY GOES TO THE DEATH SQUADS(PERP) WHICH ARE GUILTY OF THOUSANDS OF MURDERS COMMITED AMID HELLISH TORTURES.

IN AN OFFICIAL RADIO AND TELEVISION BROADCAST, CHAVEZ CACERES TODAY ACCUSED THE FMLN(PERP) OF DESTROYING SOME RESIDENCES IN THE EXCLUSIVE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD WITH DYNAMITE, IN NORTHWEST SAN SALVADOR, AND OF FIRING ON PRIVATE VEHICLES IN HIGH- AND MIDDLE-CLASS SAN SALVADOR NEIGHBORHOODS.

THE FMLN(PERP) GUERRILLAS TODAY VACATED THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD AFTER HOLDING, FOR OVER 24 HOURS, SEVERAL HOUSES THERE, FROM WHICH THEY CONFRONTED THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS.

THE FMLN(PERP) ANNOUNCED A TRUCE FROM 0600 TO 1200 (1200 TO 1800 GMT) TODAY TO EVACUATE FOREIGNERS, DIPLOMATS, AND CIVILIAN RESIDENTS FROM ESCALON.

 SAN SALVADOR, 6 DEC 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES, BY UNIDENTIFIED SALVADORAN AND INTERNATIONAL REPORTERS] [TEXT] [PONCE, IN PROGRESS] ...THE OFFENSIVE OF THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP)(PERP)(PERP) [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT(PERP)(PERP)(PERP)(PERP)] AS OF 11 NOVEMBER HAS BEEN MILITARILY DEFEATED HERE IN THE CITY OF SAN SALVADOR, AS WELL AS IN SAN MIGUEL, USULUTAN, AND ZACATECOLUCA, WHERE THERE WAS GREATER ACTIVITY BY THE SUBVERSIVES.

[REPORTER] COLONEL, DOES THE PRESIDENT THINK THAT DURING THE COSTA RICAN MEETING ENOUGH PRESSURE CAN BE EXERTED ON NICARAGUA SO THAT IT WILL SUSPEND ASSISTANCE TO THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP)(PERP)(PERP) AND THE WAR WILL DIMINISH IN THE COUNTRY?

IN THE PREVIOUS MEETINGS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF ESQUIPULAS II, HE COMMITTED HIMSELF TO DISCONTINUING SUPPORT FOR THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP)(PERP)(PERP).

THIS TOTAL WAR OFFENSIVE THAT HAS BEEN INFLICTED UPON THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE SHOULD BE SUSPENDED, BECAUSE WE ARE SURE THAT THE MOMENT NICARAGUA AND CUBA -- IT IS THROUGH THOSE COUNTRIES, RATHER THOSE GOVERNMENTS THAT THE COMMUNIST BLOC HAS BEEN HELPING THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP)(PERP)(PERP) -- THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP)(PERP)(PERP) WOULD WEAKEN TREMENDOUSLY.

[SENTENCE AS HEARD]  AS A MEMBER OF THE ARMED FORCES, AS A MEMBER OF THE HIGH COMMAND, I FEEL VERY PROUD ABOUT THE PROFESSIONAL, DETERMINED, AND COURAGEOUS ATTITUDE WITH WHICH THE OFFICERS, NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS, AND TROOPS OF OUR ARMED FORCES HAVE NEUTRALIZED AND DEFEATED THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP)(PERP)(PERP) OFFENSIVE.

AFTER BREAKING UP THE ENEMY'S DEFENSIVE POSITIONS IN SAN SALVADOR, THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP) OCCUPIED VARIOUS AREAS IN THE CAPITAL.

IN AYUTUXTEPEQUE THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP) CARRIED OUT ANNIHILATION MANEUVERS AGAINST THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE'S SORIANO BATTALION, WHICH WAS STATIONED ON EL CARMEN HILL WHERE WE KILLED 15 SOLDIERS AND WOUNDED 30.

THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP) SEIZED FIVE M-16 RIFLES, ONE [WORD INDISTINCT] GRENADE LAUNCHER, [WORDS INDISTINCT], FOUR M-60 MACHINEGUNS FROM THE ANNIHILATED TROOPS.

AT THE SAME TIME, THE POLL REVEALS A CLEAR REJECTION OF THE DAMAGE INFLICTED BY TERRORISM AND THE POSSIBLE PARTICIPATION OF THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP) IN THE MURDERS OF THE FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION] LEADERS AND THE JESUIT PRIESTS.

WHEN ASKED WHO THEY THOUGHT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BREAKING OF THE DIALOGUE, 63 PERCENT SAID THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP); 5.7 PERCENT SAID THE ARMED FORCES; 4.3 PERCENT SAID THE GOVERNMENT; 22.7 PERCENT SAID THEY DO NOT KNOW; AND 3.9 PERCENT DID NOT RESPOND.

WHEN ASKED WHO THEY BELIEVED WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FENASTRAS MASSACRE, 26.3 PERCENT SAID THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP); 6.3 PERCENT SAID THE ARMED FORCES; 3.3 PERCENT SAID THE GOVERNMENT; 55.7 PERCENT SAID THEY DID NOT KNOW; AND 8.4 PERCENT DID NOT RESPOND.

REGARDING THE MASSACRE OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, 26 PERCENT ATTRIBUTED IT TO THE FMLN(PERP)(PERP); 7 PERCENT TO THE ARMED FORCES; 5.3 PERCENT TO THE GOVERNMENT; 53.3 PERCENT SAID THEY DID NOT KNOW; AND 8.4 PERCENT DID NOT RESPOND.

#########################################################


WE BELIEVE THAT STILL, REGRETTABLY, FOLLOWING THE FMLN(PERP)'S [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT(PERP)] IRRATIONALITY, WE CANNOT RULE OUT A CONTINUATION OF THEIR VIOLENT ACTIONS.

THE MILITARY, HOWEVER, HAVE TAKEN THE OFFENSIVE IN THESE THREE AREAS WHERE THE FMLN(PERP) GROUPS HAVE BEEN CHASED.

FIGHTING HAS TAKEN PLACE OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS, WITH OVER 100 CASUALTIES INFLICTED UPON THE FMLN(PERP) IN 3 DAYS.

PRESIDENT CRISTIANI SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION AT THE 10 DECEMBER PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT WILL BE OPEN TO THE POSSIBILITY OF RESTARTING A DIALOGUE WITH THE INSURGENTS ON 20 DECEMBER, IN CARACAS, VENEZUELA, AS LONG AS THE FMLN(PERP) NO LONGER CARRIES OUT ARMED ACTIONS IN URBAN AREAS, BUT THEY DO NOT HAVE TO LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND SHOULD CONTINUE ACTIONS ONLY AGAINST MILITARY TARGETS.

IT HAS BEEN THE FMLN(PERP) THAT UNILATERALLY BROKE THIS DIALOGUE PROCESS BY NOT TURNING UP AT CARACAS, VENEZULA, AS HAD BEEN AGREED IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA.

MOST CONVENIENT WOULD BE FOR THIS TO TAKE PLACE IN CARACAS, WITH THE FOLLOWING CONDITION: BEGINING 15 DECEMBER, 3 DAYS AFTER THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL MEETING [3-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION], THE FMLN(PERP) SHOULD PUBLICLY DECLARE AND GIVE PROOF OF COMPLIANCE THAT IT WILL END ALL TYPES OF TERRORIST ACTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY AFFECT CIVILIANS.

IF THE FMLN(PERP) CONTINUES ITS IRRATIONAL BEHAVIOR, THE ARMED FORCES WILL CONTINUE FIGHTING THEM.

WE THINK THE LEAST THE FMLN(PERP) CAN DO IS TO STOP ALL ACTIONS THAT AFFECT, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.

THE CESSATION OF TERRORIST ACTS SHOULD BE THE FMLN(PERP)'S PROOF OF SINCERITY AND WILL TO REALLY TRY AND SEEK A SOLUTION BY WAY OF DIALOGUE.

IF THE FMLN(PERP) TODAY ACCEPTS ENDING ALL ACTIONS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION, THEN WE ARE WILLING ON 20 DECEMBER TO GO TO CARACAS AND TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE PROCESS AND TALKS ON ALL THE TOPICS THE FMLN(PERP) WISHES TO TALK ABOUT.

 HAVANA (CUBA), 13 DEC 89 (INTERNATIONAL SERVICE) -- [INTERVIEW WITH SALVADORAN RICARDO MONTENEGRO, MEMBER OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT(PERP), FMLN(PERP) "RADIO VENCEREMOS INTERNATIONAL SERVICE," BY JORGE LUIS BERNARD] [TEXT] [BERNARD] MONTENEGRO, WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THE THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT(PERP) [FMLN(PERP)] WILL CONTINUE WITH THE CURRENT MILITARY OFFENSIVE THAT BEGAN ON 11 NOVEMBER SINCE THE AGREEMENT AMONG THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS WAS SIGNED?

[MONTENEGRO] THE TRUTH IS THAT THE REASONS WHY THE FMLN(PERP) BEGAN ITS OFFENSIVE ON 11 NOVEMBER 1989 HAVE NOT CHANGED AT ALL.

THUS, THE FMLN(PERP) CANNOT STOP ITS OFFENSIVE.

ON THE CONTRARY, WHAT HAPPENED IN EL SALVADOR IS THAT THE FMLN(PERP) OFFENSIVE STRATEGICALLY TURNED THE WAR.

YESTERDAY, 12 DECEMBER, THE FMLN(PERP) ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE WHICH VEHEMENTLY EXPRESSED ITS ABSOLUTE REJECTION OF THE AGREEMENT SIGNED AT THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT.

AT PRESENT, THE FMLN(PERP) BELIEVES THAT DESPITE WHAT THE OTHER FOUR CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS SAY, IT IS CLEARER THAN EVER THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS A FASCIST, MILITARY DICTATORSHIP.

THEREFORE, ANY ATTEMPT TO HELP THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT OR ANY KIND OF SUPPORT GIVEN TO IT NOTHING BUT A PIECE OF PAPER THAT DOES NOT HAVE TOO MUCH VALIDITY TO THE FMLN(PERP).

[BERNARD] IN OTHER WORDS COMRADE, THE FMLN(PERP) WILL MAINTAIN THE SAME LEVEL OF CONFRONTATION WITH THE DICTATORSHIP?

[MONTENEGRO] I BELIEVE THE FMLN(PERP)'S ARMED STRUGGLE IS NOW MORE LEGITIMATE THAN EVER.

THE SUMMIT CONFIRMED THE LEGITIMACY OF THE FMLN(PERP)'S STRUGGLE, BECAUSE THE AGREEMENT RESULTING FROM THAT SUMMIT IS NEITHER FEASIBLE NOR REAL.

THE FMLN(PERP) WILL THEREFORE CONTINUE ITS POLITICAL - MILITARY OFFENSIVE.

THE FMLN(PERP) WILL INCREASE ITS ACTIONS.

THE FMLN(PERP) IS REORGANIZING [READECUAR] ITS POLITICAL - MILITARY APPARATUS.

IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS, WE WILL CLEARLY SHOW WHAT THE FMLN(PERP) CAN DO.

THE FMLN(PERP) WILL NOT SURRENDER ITS WEAPONS, ESPECIALLY NOW.

THE FMLN(PERP) HAS NO OBLIGATION TO ABIDE BY AN AGREEMENT THAT DOES NOT REFLECT THE SALVADORAN REALITY AT ALL.

[MONTENEGRO] AS I TOLD YOU EARLIER IN ANSWERING THE FIRST QUESTION, THE FIRST THING IS THAT THE FMLN(PERP) DEFINATELY CHANGED THE WAR.

THIS MEANS THAT THE FMLN(PERP) MADE THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES RETREAT FROM THE MOUNTAINS TO THE HEART OF THE CITIES INCLUDING THE CAPITAL CITY OF SAN SALVADOR.

BUT IN ANY CASE, A STRONG BLOW BY THE FMLN(PERP) FORCES IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR SOMEWHERE IN EL SALVADOR AT ANY TIME.

[NO NUMBERS 1 AND 2 AS HEARD] THE SALVADORAN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE(PERP)(PERP), THE PERPETRATORS, KNEW THE JESUIT CENTER AND THE JESUIT RESIDENCE.

THE SCENE OF THE CRIME IS LOCATED INSIDE AN ARMY CONTROL AND SECURITY AREA SINCE THE ARMED FORCES(PERP)(PERP) JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF IS LOCATED IN THAT SAME GENERAL AREA.

DESPITE THE EVIDENT AND VERIFIABLE MILITARIZATION OF THE AREA WHERE THE CRIME TOOK PLACE, THE CURFEW, THE EXTENDED AND HEAVY FIRING INSIDE THE UCA PREMISES, THE DETONATION OF EXPLOSIVES FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME DURING WHICH THE PERPETRATORS REMAINED INSIDE THE JESUIT FACILITIES -- WHICH GAVE THE PERPETRATORS TIME TO SEARCH THE JESUIT PRIESTS' ROOMS, KILL THEM ALONG WITH THE OTHER TWO VICTIMS, AND SEARCH AND BURN THE JESUIT CENTER CHURCH, THUS PROVING THE SIZE OF THE OPERATION -- THE ARMED FORCES(PERP)(PERP) DID NOT REACT AS THEY WOULD HAVE IF THIS OPERATION HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT BY THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT].

THIS INDICATES THAT THE SOLDIERS IN CHARGE OF SECURITY IN THE MANUEL JOSE ARCE MILITARY NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE ARMED FORCES(PERP)(PERP) JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF INSTALLATIONS WERE AWARE OF THE OPERATION THAT WAS BEING CARRIED OUT.

THEREFORE, THE ARCHBISHOPRIC'S LEGAL ASSISTANCE OFFICE CONCLUDES THAT ALL THE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT MILITARY PERSONNEL OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES(PERP)(PERP)(PERP)(PERP) ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MURDER OF THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS AND THE TWO MAIDS.

WE ALSO MUST ADD TO THIS LIST OF ACHIEVEMENTS THAT THE GREAT CONCENTRATION OF ENEMY ARMY(PERP) OPERATIONAL FORCES IN THE CAPITAL HAS CAUSED A GREAT NATIONAL IMBALANCE IN FORCES.

WE MUST ALSO RECORD AS ONE OF THE SUCCESSES OF OUR GENERAL OFFENSIVE DURING THIS FIRST MONTH THE FACT THAT THE PUPPET ARMY(PERP) WAS FORCED TO ABORT ANOTHER PLAN.

EVEN THOUGH THERE WERE SOME BLOODY EVENTS, SUCH AS THE MURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, ALONG WITH A GREAT AMOUNT OF KIDNAPPINGS AND MISSING PEOPLE AND ARRESTS OF MEMBERS OR LEADERS OF GRASSROOT PEOPLE'S MOVEMENTS, WE FEEL THAT THE ARMY(PERP) AND REPRESSIVE CORPS ARE INCAPABLE OF ATTENDING TO THE FMLN OFFENSIVE AND THE BESIEGEMENT AT THE SAME TIME THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO CARRY OUT THEIR ANNIHILATION OF THE PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT.

 SAN SALVADOR, 12 DEC 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] MANY POLITICAL, UNION, UNIVERSITY, RELIGIOUS, AND CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN "BEHEADED" BY THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS A MONTH AGO, BY THE ARMY(PERP)'S RESPONSE TO THE OFFENSIVE, AND BY EXTREMIST GROUPS' RETALIATORY ACTIONS.

ACCORDING TO RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATION SOURCES, APPROXIMATELY 50 PRIESTS -- SALVADORAN AND FOREIGNERS -- HAVE LEFT THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY FELT "PERSECUTED" BY THE ARMY(PERP) WHICH LINKS THEM TO THE GUERRILLAS.

"PROCESO" MANTAINS THAT "APPARENTLY, THEY WANTED TO STRIKE ONE SINGLE BLOW AND BEHEAD EVERY ORGANIZATION LABELED BY GOVERNMENT(PERP) PROPAGANDA AS AN FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] FACADE."

HOWEVER, SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI SAID BEFORE HE LEFT TO ATTEND A CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT IN COSTA RICA, THAT HIS GOVERNMENT(PERP) DOES NOT PERSECUTE RELIGIOUS LEADERS.

THREE DAYS AFTER THE GUERRILLAS STARTED THEIR LARGEST OFFENSIVE IN THE DECADE -- ON 14 NOVEMBER -- GUILLERMO UNGO AND HECTOR OQUELI, THE MAIN LEFTIST OPPOSITION LEADERS, LEFT EL SALVADOR, SAYING THAT THEY HAD RECEIVED DEATH THREATS IN MESSAGES BROADCAST OVER THE GOVERNMENT(PERP)'S RADIO NETWORK.

LEADERS OF THE GENERAL CONFEDERATION OF WORKERS (CGT) -- WHICH IS LINKED TO THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY -- HAVE REPORTED THAT THEY ARE BEING PERSECUTED AND BLAME THE ARMY(PERP) AND THE GUERRILLAS FOR "VIOLATING HUMAN RIGHTS."

CGT LEADER JOSE LUIS GRANDE PREZA ASSERTED THAT "TO RECUPERATE AND MANTAIN THEIR PRIVILEGES, THE EXTREME RIGHTISTS HAVE UNSCRUPULOUSLY TURNED THE ARMY(PERP) AGAINST ITS OWN PEOPLE AND GENERATED REPRESSION AND PERSECUTION AGAINST THE CHURCH, THE OPPOSITION, AND UNION MOVEMENTS."

LUDOVICO SAMAYOA, DEPUTY OF THE MAIN OPPOSITION CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY [PDC], ASSERTED THAT TWO PDC MUNICIPAL OFFICIALS IN ILOBASCO HAD BEEN ARRESTED BY ARMY(PERP) MEMBERS IN THE PAST FEW DAYS.

"THE GOVERNMENT(PERP) HAS INITIATED A GENERALIZED REPRESSION TO DISMANTLE THE PARTY AND FRIGHTEN OUR MEMBERS WITH THESE ARRESTS," SAID SAMAYOA.

HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION COORDINATOR MIGUEL MONTENEGRO SAID THAT HIS OFFICE, AS WELL AS OTHER OFFICES OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT OPPOSE THE GOVERNMENT(PERP), "WERE SEARCHED AND DESTROYED BY BOMBS" IN THE EASTERN CITY OF SAN MIGUEL.

COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, JOINT CHIEF OF STAFF, DISREGARDED THIS POSSIBILITY AND SAID THAT THE SITUATION OF VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY, PARTICULARLY SINCE THE FMLN(PERP) [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT(PERP)] OFFENSIVE, REQUIRES, MORE THAN EVER, THAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE MILITARILY STABLE.

[BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE FMLN(PERP) HAS FAILED, MILITARILY SPEAKING.

THE FMLN(PERP)'S FAMOUS ALL - THE - WAY OFFENSIVE HAS ENDED IN TREMENDOUS FAILURE, DETERMINED BY THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

WE CAN ANTICIPATE THAT THE FMLN(PERP) WILL CONTINUE ITS SABOTAGING ACTIONS AND TERRORISM WHICH COULD DESTROY STORES IN SAN SALVADOR, AS WELL AS POSTS AND PYLONS ON HIGHWAYS.

THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE CAN REST ASSURED, HOWEVER, THAT AN OFFENSIVE ACTION BY THE FMLN(PERP) AT PRESENT CAN BE DISREGARDED.

HE ADDED THAT SUCH A MEASURE, HOWEVER, WILL DEPEND ON THE FMLN(PERP)'S STANCE.

FINALLY, PONCE REPORTED THAT THE FMLN(PERP) MACHINEGUNNED A BUILDING WITH COFFEE HARVESTERS IN SANTA ANA AND MAIMED TWO PEOPLE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY REFUSED TO STOP HARVESTING COFFEE.

SECONDLY, I THINK THAT I HAVE MENTIONED BEFORE THAT IT IS NOT THE RESULT OF THE ELECTION THAT WILL CHANGE OUR ATTITUDE WITH RESPECT TO OUR DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA, BUT RATHER THE ATTITUDE OF THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT WITH RESPECT TO AID TO THE FMLN(PERP), TO THE MARXIST GUERRILLAS IN EL SALVADOR.

WITH RESPECT TO THE THIRD QUESTION, OBVIOUSLY I THINK THAT IF MRS CHAMORRO REALLY IS IN CONTROL, IN TOTAL CONTROL, ESPECIALLY OF THE SANDINISTA ARMY, THAT THERE WILL BE A STOP IN AID, AND THEREFORE THE FMLN(PERP) WOULD NOT HAVE NICARAGUA'S LOGISTICAL AND MILITARY SUPPORT FOR THEM.

[CRISTIANI, IN ENGLISH] WELL, IF WE COULD TRY AND PUT INTO ONE BASKET AND CALL THAT BASKET WITH A NAME WITH RESPECT TO THE ACTIONS, WE ARE ASKING THE FMLN(PERP) TO STOP TERRORIST ACTIVITIES, BECAUSE TERRORIST ACTIVITY IS AFFECTING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.

THE FMLN(PERP) HAS TO STOP ALL TERRORIST ACTIVITY, BECAUSE THAT IS THE ACTIVITY THAT HURTS THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.

HOWEVER, WE VIEW AS A NEGATIVE THAT IN THE GOVERNMENT(PERP)(PERP)'S RESPONSE THERE IS NOT A CORRESPONDING ATTITUDE.

THE GOVERNMENT(PERP)(PERP) RESPONSE TRIES TO UNDERMINE OUR GESTURE.

THE GOVERNMENT(PERP)(PERP) AND THE ARMED FORCES(PERP)(PERP) CONTINUE TO VIOLATE HUMAN RIGHTS, BOMB CIVILIAN POPULATED AREAS, SUBJECT THE COUNTRY TO A PERMANENT STATE OF SIEGE, BE IT LEGAL OR DE FACTO.

IN A CONSTANT AND SYSTEMATIC MANNER, THE GOVERNMENT(PERP)(PERP) MAINTAINS A POLICY OF CAPTURING AND TORTURING LEADERS OF PEOPLE'S GROUPS; MAINTAINS SIEGES AND RAIDS; HARASSES THE COMMUNITIES OF REPATRIATES; AND SABOTAGES THE PROPERTY OF RESIDENTS IN AREAS UNDER THE FMLN CONTROL.

THE GOVERNMENT(PERP)(PERP) INTENDS TO APPOINT AS DEFENSE MINISTER THE PERSON WHO GAVE THE ORDER TO MURDER THE PRIESTS, AND IT ALLOWS THE REPORTED EXECUTIONER TO LIVE IN A LUXURY APARTMENT.

THE GOVERNMENT(PERP)(PERP) IS MORALLY AND POLITICALLY COMPELLED TO IMPLEMENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE GOODWILL GESTURES THAT WILL PERMIT THE EXERCISE OF CITIZEN'S FREEDOMS AND CEASE THE DAILY HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND ALL FORMS OF AGGRESSION AIMED AT THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.

 BOGOTA, NO DATE (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [INTERVIEW WITH LEMOS BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [REPORTER] JARAMILLO OSSA HAS SAID THAT FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS HE HAD ASKED THE GOVERNMENT(PERP) FOR PROTECTION, THAT HIS LIFE WAS IN DANGER, AND THAT HE HELD THE GOVERNMENT(PERP) DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR WHATEVER HAPPENED TO HIM.

[REPORTER] THAT IS WHAT JARAMILLO OSSA SAID, THAT THE GOVERNMENT(PERP) WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS SAFETY DURING THE PAST 4 YEARS.

AS A GOVERNMENT(PERP) OFFICIAL, I AM OBLIGED TO APPEAR BEFORE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO EXPLAIN MY ACTIONS, BUT NOW IS NOT THE MOMENT TO EXPLAIN ANYTHING.

IT IS EVIDENT THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE SEEKING A GOAL OPPOSITE TO THAT OF THE GOVERNMENT(PERP) ARE INVOLVED IN THIS.

THE GOVERNMENT(PERP) WANTS A FREE ELECTORAL PROCESS; IT IS COMMITTED TO THAT.

TODAY, WHEN WE HAVE A COMPLETELY ORDERLY ELECTORAL PROCESS, IT WOULD BE ABSURD, ILLOGICAL, IRRATIONAL, AND SENSELESS FOR THE GOVERNMENT(PERP) TO PROMOTE ACTIONS THAT RUN COUNTER TO ITS GOAL OF ENSURING THAT ITS TERM ENDS IN PEACE AND THAT THE ELECTIONS WILL TAKE PLACE NORMALLY.

[REPORTER] THE UP HAS AGAIN CAST DOUBT OVER THE GOVERNMENT(PERP)'S GUARANTEES FOR THE CANDIDATES AND THE PARTY.

[LEMOS] I BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNMENT(PERP) HAS DONE EVERYTHING HUMANLY POSSIBLE TO GUARANTEE THE SAFETY OF CANDIDATES, NOT ONLY THE SAFETY OF UP MEMBERS, BUT OF ALL PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES, REGARDLESS OF THEIR AFFILIATION.

[WORDS INDISTINCT] IN THEIR COMMUNIQUE, EVIDENCE OF THE FACT THAT DR JARAMILLO'S BODYGUARDS REACTED AND, I UNDERSTAND, BY KILLING ONE OF THE ASSASSINS, AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT I HAVE HEARD, AND ARRESTED ANOTHER ONE, WHICH HAS BEEN CONFIRMED, SHOWS THAT THE GOVERNMENT(PERP) IS INDEED OFFERING PROTECTION.

THEREFORE, DR. JARAMILLO WAS INDEED ENJOYING GOVERNMENT(PERP) PROTECTION JUST AS THE OTHER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ARE.

I BELIEVE THAT SUITS MUST BE FILED BY THOSE WHO SUSPECT THAT A GOVERNMENT(PERP) OFFICIAL, AND MYSELF PARTICULARLY, MAY BE INVOLVED IN THE ASSASSINATION, TO ENSURE THAT THE INCIDENT IS INVESTIGATED.

SHINING PATH MEMBERS RECENTLY MURDERED 19 PEOPLE, INCLUDING 10 CHILDREN, IN A SMALL VILLAGE NEAR HUANCAYO CITY, 415 KM SOUTH OF LIMA.

THIS ACT CLEARLY SHOWS THAT THE MAOISTS(PERP) ARE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE KILLING AND DESTROYING.

SOME 300 PEOPLE WERE MURDERED BY THE SHINING PATH(PERP)(PERP) DURING THE BOYCOTT OF THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS ON 12 NOVEMBER 1989.

THE ATTACKS PERPETRATED BY THE MRTA(PERP) LAST NIGHT BELIES THE ALLEGED ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THEY WILL CEASE TO USE VIOLENCE.

ON 28 MARCH 1990, THE ARMY AND THE NATIONAL POLICE(PERP) ELITE CORPS(PERP)(PERP) CARRIED OUT MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE HIGHER PARTS OF ENVIGADO MUNICIPALITY.

IN SAID OPERATIONS, THE ELITE CORPS(PERP) ARRESTED COLOMBIAN CITIZENS FREDDY LOPEZ OSPINA AND JOSE CRISTANTO RETAVISTA ARZON, WHO REMAIN MISSING.

IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS IN MEDELLIN, IT HAS BEEN THE CUSTOM OF THE ELITE CORPS(PERP) TO ARREST PEOPLE AND TAKE THEM TO THE CARLOS HOLGUIN POLICE ACADEMY, WHERE THEY ARE TORTURED AND EXECUTED BY MEMBERS OF THE BOGOTA DIJIN [DIRECTORATE OF JUDICIAL POLICE AND INVESTIGATIONS], WHO ARE IN THE CAPITAL OF ANTIOQUIA.

WE HAVE DENOUNCED THESE EVENTS PUBLICLY ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, BUT PRESIDENT BARCO HAS RESPONDED IN STATEMENTS TO THE PRESS THAT THOSE MEMBERS OF THE ELITE CORPS(PERP) ARE DEFENDERS OF DEMOCRACY.

THE COMMANDER OF THE ELITE CORPS(PERP) IN ANTIOQUIA, AND COLONEL PELAEZ, CHIEF OF THE BOGOTA DIJIN, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MURDER OF ALL OUR COMRADES AND FOR THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE TWO AFOREMENTIONED CITIZENS.

CONCERNING THE DIALOGUE IN GENEVA, I BELIEVE THAT TOMORROW THERE WILL BE A BRIEFING WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF DELEGATES FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN(PERP) [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT(PERP)] TOGETHER WITH THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL, WHO WILL ANNOUNCE THE MECHANISMS TO BE FOLLOWED IN THIS DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN(PERP).

[PONCE] WE, THE ARMED FORCES, FEEL THAT THESE EVENTS ARE CARRIED OUT BY THE TERRORISTS WITHIN THE FMLN(PERP) WHO DO NOT BELIEVE DIALOGUE IS A MECHANISM FOR ACHIEIVING PEACE IN OUR COUNTRY.


#########################################################


THIS AND MANY OTHER ACTS OF VIOLENCE WHICH HAVE RECENTLY OCCURRED CONTRADICT THE IMAGE THAT THE FMLN(PERP) HAD PREVIOUSLY TRIED TO CREATE WITH ITS DECISION NOT TO CONTINUE SABOTAGING THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATIONS SECTORS, AS WELL AS BUSINESSES.

WE WANT TO BELIEVE THAT THESE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT BY TERRORISTS WHO ARE OUT OF THE FMLN(PERP) LEADERS' CONTROL, BECAUSE, AS I SAID, THIS DOES NOT HELP AT ALL TO CREATE THE APPROPRIATE ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH TO SEEK PEACE IN OUR COUNTRY.

[PONCE] TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT CURRENT VIOLENT ACTIONS MIGHT COME FROM GROUPS OUTSIDE THE CONTROL OF FMLN(PERP) LEADERS, WE BELIEVE THAT THE COUNTRY'S SITUATION IS NOT NORMAL ENOUGH TO SAY THAT THERE IS NO VIOLENCE.
